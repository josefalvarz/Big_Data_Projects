Visualizations â€“ Tesla Subreddit Analysis

This folder contains the visual insights from the Tesla Reddit Sentiment Analysis project.  
It is divided into two parts:

- Tableau - Dashboards and charts showing subreddit activity, sentiment trends, and engagement quality.  
- Word Cloud - Word clouds highlighting the most frequent terms by sentiment, with a special focus on the technology subreddit, which had the highest activity but also a large share of negative comments.

Together, these visuals complement the Hadoop and Python processing by providing an accessible view of how different communities engage with Tesla and which aspects drive positive vs. negative discussions.
