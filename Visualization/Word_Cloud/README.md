Word Clouds â€“ Tesla Subreddit Analysis

This folder contains word clouds Python/VADER generated from the cleaned Reddit data, grouped by sentiment.  
We also created focused word clouds for the technology subreddit, since the analysis showed it had the highest number of comments and a large share of negative sentiment.  
The word clouds paired with the graph of sentiment over time, allowed us to investigate through the internet what was the origin of Tesla's audience comments, analyze the impact they had and provide suggestions to Tesla for continous growth.


1. Positive Sentiment (All subreddits)
- Common words: tesla, car, stock, market, company, new, vehicle.  
- The "Automated Vehicle Framework" (a plan to loosen regulations on autonomous vehicles) by the US Department of Transportion, together with the fact that Elon Musk stepped down as a Government employee gave investors hope and trust in the growth of Tesla. The community saw this news as positive and this was reflected in the posts and in the market (Rise in Tesla's shares).


2. Negative Sentiment (All subreddits)
- Common words: tesla, market, us, company, tariffs, stock, ev, sales.  
- Tarrifs by the US Government made the community leave negative comments related to market, stock and sales.


3. Neutral (Technology Subreddit)
- Frequent mentions: tesla, sales, cybertruck, robotaxi, software, china.  
- Neutral focus on new product announcements and company operations.


4. Negative (Technology Subreddit)
- Frequent mentions: tesla, cybertruck, sales, odometer, selfdriving, model Y.  
- This specific subreddit highlights that negative aspects spin around Tesla's cars specially with the Cybertruck. This problem was originated in March when Tesla issued an eigth recall for around 46,100 Cybertrucks. The problem was a "stainless-steel trim piece" on the vehicle's windshield that could detach while driving, provoking a major risk for the driver's security. This major event turned on the critics as reflected in this specifically subreddit.


Conclusion
- Word clouds reveal that positive sentiment is tied to market growth and investement, while negative comments come in majority from Tesla's cars specially the Cybertruck. As a personal recommendation to Tesla based on this analysis I will suggest that the company continue to put the client first and hear carefully about any crtic that comes to the car, because a client who critics your product is a faithful client who wants to see improvements.
