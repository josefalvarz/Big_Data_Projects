appliance like personality started to zip lot joy from day to day driving experience easy likewise loved corvette wasnt quite scratching performance itch way really wanted to weekend driver felt like lot money to put something experiencing weekends eventually to return corvette to gm due to warranty issue used opportunity to porsche taycan gts porsche folks car optioned following premium package thermally noise insulated glass adaptive cruise control leather interior rear wheel steer porsche dynamic chasis control porsche torque vectoring sports chrono car in pretty nice gts color spec which check out id like to mention driven quite different obtainable cars list following c corvette v th gen camaro c grand sport c corvette z c corvette z tesla model awd prehighland tesla model performance porsche taycan turbo taycan porsche turbo porsche cayman base alfa romeo c alfa romeo giulia qv ford focus rs audi r v audi ttrs lotus evora na lotus evora lotus elise ill mainly comparing car to experience owning model performance c handling first drove taycan years ago absolutely blown away cars handling to legitimately felt sports car like offering incredibly comfortable ride living car months general opinion theres nuances picked up rear wheel steer air suspension porsche dynamic chassis control active sway bars porsche torque vectoring limited slip differential theres lot suspension magic allowing car to show flashes brilliance whenever take corner rear wheel steer helps give car impression incredibly sharp precise turn in pdcc system keeps car sportscar flat in long corners feel torque vectoringlimited slip differential system help tuck car in flying particularly interesting corner lastly air suspension gives fantastic range floating barely feel imperfection road dampening in normal mode up to tight controlled always composed dampening in sports plus mention elements pretty cool seeing car utilize magic allows car to showcase really broad range handling characteristics happen to like certain element given sports cars handling its likely taycan showcase characteristic likewise theres lot times suspension tools allow to pull stupid maneuvers youd think twice in anything thats basically mclaren impressive taycans handling notice cars weight size reveal themselves almost selectively kind learn to drive around instance twisty road find yourself almost immediately coming onto brakes partially accelerate pretty darn rapidly coming out corner may find yourself hitting mph another car may up mph in distance car weighs much sense braking going to little bit process wont able to completely bail yourself out trouble find yourself in late braking event car great job shrinking around driving sense changing direction isnt quite immediate would in another car steering effort requires bit muscle would compared to something lighter likewise general sensation gforces much quicker in car due to its weight whats interesting though feel cars weight managed well dont necessarily mind instance taycans suspension magic allowed to throw car turns way harder way confidence enjoyment able to in c z isnt to say taycans handling better cs per say its theres level safety ease access available in taycans handling havent experienced another car thus far streets being able to impressive maneuvers consistency sense safety much important car high limits could bite approach limits likewise model would lose regen due to high battery charge car would feel piglike much harder to control much harder to manage speed could tell model really relied regen to stay light its feet taycan whether regen cars driving dynamics feel similar found taycans brakes to work generally well in canyon driving feel like plenty stopping power though mentioned want to brakes sooner rather later due to weight around town brakes consistent easy to modulate taycan features blended regen braking system using brakes starts high amount regen back system friction brakes added in additional stopping power necessary tail end deceleration to bring car to complete stop advantage system dont feel like penalized using brake pedal in tesla whenever touch brake pedal using friction brakes ran taycans blended braking odd points coming to complete stop feel regen brakes let go friction brakes take happens feel car almost want to lurch forward little transition point becomes odd pause in deceleration curve regen car progressively slowing down regen lets go car slow down let go point friction brakes take car comes to complete stop happens certain speeds braking distances its anywhere near consistent weird brake wire funkyness felt in giulua qv think its area improvement porsche surprisingly big fan cars steering feel personally super annoyed see car reviewers talk steering feel theyll always review awesome car looks to lot fun theyll go doesnt steering feel thats important theyll give nod to car thats expensive looks crappier ultimately slower better steering feel driver inputs its definitely better car always feel like its equivalent sleeping girl complaining fact wasnt blonde girl better blonde dont know who owned elise spent plenty time in evoras variety sports cars never found steering feel to make up cars deficiencies in areas anyways taycans steering feel makes car delightful to drive theres plenty offcentered responsiveness chassis wheels turn wheel feel car responding reacting to dont want to say gets tons feedback wheel per say something steering makes feel connected to road comfortable sporty time steering feel reason to buy taycan wouldnt say its something reveals itself to drive car really delight big item noticed taycans handling continues to feel sharp responsive well past mph model performance youd start to feel car bit uncomfortable its handling braking past mph gives highway driving rather nice dimension in taycan basically experience cars handling prowess matter what speed going in id say taycan one enjoyable handling cars street today theres definitely ice vehicles out less weight higher limits what always found ice vehicles narrow fun window thats safe to experience demonstrate streets taycan kind throw corners let suspension magic amaze yes know going to talk its important to feel lightweight analog dance something like miata car lower limits gauge handling having complete confidence in car matter maneuver situation in regard taycan continues to impress day power power taycan interesting experience car much likes to roll onto accelerator stab throttle in sports plus mode feels like car almost hesitates eases its acceleration really picking up speed moments later id contrast model performance which super sharp initial throttle response wants to blast from mph immense wave torque put foot way down interestingly though taycan feels little sluggish line car continues to pull quite hard well north mph pedal travel feels little long what particularly noticed depress pedal car continues to offer acceleration instance in model could going mph blip accelerator really feel much additional acceleration due to being towards top cars torque curve in taycan could mph accelerator blip feel noticeable increase in acceleration increase to accelerator blip feel speed start to gain basically taycan doesnt exactly throw its power from lower speeds like youd expect from evs nowadays gives plenty additional power acceleration continue to use accelerator pedal strategy interesting side effects dont exactly feel like blatantly outdrag like youd able to in tesla pedal travel long car continues to build speed accelerations feel much satisfying to experience instance holding down accelerator seconds in taycan feels much rewarding holding down accelerator seconds in model performance though model performance may deliver gs initial speed acceleration likewise taycan likes to continue to build speed found hitting triple digits lot in carlike lot lot its odd sensation dont necessarily crazy acceleration gs would evs find yourself ultimately having rewarding accelerations going much faster end day taycan speed transmission which accounts lot cars topend found speed transmission to awesome works little disappointing in scenarios feels like st gear ends somewhere in mph range nd gear starts slightly north mph in sports mode sports plus car start in st around mph in normal mode car starts in nd gear pretty much stays in nd whole time in st gear teslalike amount acceleration line its meaty rapid wave torque in st nd gear tons additional top end build however hit accelerator say mph car knows its going to run out st gear soon subtly cuts power nd gear car starts to pull hard afterwards oddly enough its possible to inconsistent torque acceleration levels depending speed pull mph may feel way harder pull mph simply car limiting torque mph in anticipation shifting nd id contrast evs pull x mph always going to feel matter what personally found to little frustrating times car blown away its acceleration gotten speed gearing correct times car hasnt really taken in mans land from gearing perspective its kind odd to to deal in ev speed transmission aside felt like cars traction control little less dialed in could in model felt like car always willing to give amount torque power possibly could given driving conditions in taycan sometimes feel like car pulling power in situations model wouldnt pulling power find interesting considering taycans suspension generally makes feel composed across board compared to model to could side effect teslas hardware being better integrated porsches in launch control found taycan gts feels ever slightly less powerful old model performance line mentioned acceleration feels much rewarding gratifying to stay buried in compared to model likewise though c corvette higher objective acceleration numbers taycan feels much faster canyon roads its able to deliver gobs torque consistently c one interesting observation noticed taycans speedometer appears to read mph faster external measurements instance drive past speed limit warning board pretty consistently commute taycan say going mph warning board say going mph dont particularly care either way found to interesting observation havent verified cross referencing gps measurements like draggy noticed pretty consistently in id say taycan gts kind odd car feel slower its numbers indicate times to speeds much higher faster youd in cars definitely dont feel like missing speed compared to model performance which objectively bit stronger puller line wish taycans power delivery bit consistent in terms managing traction control in managing power shifting styling personally really enjoy styling taycan its one cars looks properly close to its original concept find to great blend sportiness elegance technological forwardness taycan one door cars think feels properly sports carlike in sedan form every door car generally know sedan stuff to look sporty think porsche great job leveraging ev styling opportunities available to to really take cars design to high level dont find taycan to knockout chrome orange elise really nice presence to always appreciate looking every time walk up to car what particularly enjoy taycans styling really nice way fitting in everywhere goes take car to hot valet spot its often parked out front in bad part town somehow doesnt draw ton negative attention wanting to mix up flashy cars holds its in terms looks fit in wherever go style found much easier time driving car spiritedly whenever want to in old c would truly notice people treating worse in traffic drive c spiritedly always felt like drew almost much attention theres real accessibility to taycans styling havent quite experienced in vehicles boy racer soft elegant flashy subdued feel like taycan makes hard to give people negative read build quality build quality pretty big reason buying car model performance inexplicably turned itself wind noise induced rattle months ownership really wanted to avoid experience evs its easy to hear every little cabin imperfection wanted to see what porsches renown build quality brought to table definitely impression taycan built to last long everything in car feels solid doors feel weighty close confidence inspiring thump far avoided major technological drivability related issues in car generally impression car going to feel solid mile mile driven vehicle quite hard in time owning generally felt engineered really stressing being car pretty noticeable dash rattle caused from plastic hud cover heating up expanding parked outside likewise drivers side door panel slight rattle almost something loose inside car to dealer twice to resolve issues thus far havent successful to honest porsche dealer service level hasnt stellar means kind annoyed something having to navigate car relatively high msrp porsche pretty much makes one interior put in their vehicles its like car really avante garde designwork going which causing fitment challenges etc in talking to taycan members seems like one its issue charging issues others technologyinfotainment issues happen to rattle issues lot people hype up porsche pristine build quality attention to detail high level dealership experience havent quite felt much car costs in summary taycan lives in odd build quality space tell built to last really engineered parts car lot taycans tend to quirks issues shouldnt occurring in vehicles start k go up to k ironically best ev driven to date from build quality perspective wifes bolt euv rattles good nvh isolation price point technology thats deadon reliable really think gm ford stellantis make run evs play their cars right lucid tesla rivian having qc teething issues germans caught their pants down gen japanese sitting evs out big three in america normal looking evs road normal functioning tech nonbs build quality really think really carve space themselves practicality tested taycan model performance pretty worried practicality taycan physically bigger smaller trunk spaces tighter feeling cabin less storage in owning taycan really havent missed extra space lost in model performance however in day to day living compromises noticed model much larger sub trunk cavity which carry duffle bag taycans sub trunk cavity much smaller lost out emergency duffle bag used to keep theres good space to store sunglasses in taycan center console storage shallow sunglasses in empty space behind climate control screen catch particularly space really designed storage gets job done shape trunk makes every slightly hard people to squeeze luggage thats made interesting airport pickups honestly couple inches taller squared would make huge difference usability theres storage pockets behind front seats reason which wouldnt mind car badass exposed carbon seats doesnt felt like odd omission to supremely worried reverting to older tech infotainment since teslas pretty much best right taycans basically generation behind launched in essentially gens behind right what found taycan definitely misses out lot ui snazziness ease use makes up having lot model simply didnt taycans backup camera low res fish eyed kind sucks likewise its parking sensors beep in way makes hard to gauge actual proximity near objects fact taycan surround view camera generally makes parking situations lot straightforward teslas system think fisheye camera huge oversight great job helping see cross traffic almost use to see traffic coming from use mirrors to rest taycan normal turn signal stalks behave normally never fan teslas turn signal stalks shift car drive normal gear selector climate controls available without having to dig sub menu theres normal blind spot monitors taycans adaptive cruise control works doesnt phantom braking like teslas autopilot adaptive cruise control open frunk touch opposed to having to use phone in short theres lot normal car stuff in taycan balances out tech stuff lose in tesla te driven taycan realized lot teslas stuff doesnt really make easier better driving experience its kind to help mask lack hardware features probably standard in tesla tesla like going to restaurant great atmosphere soso food whereas taycan restaurant great food stuffy environment sometimes fun atmosphere reason to go to restaurant lot times to eat first found rear wheel steering taycan to pretty awesome essentially full uturn in two lane road without needing to point turn gives lot flexibility angle approach in parking lots drawback take getting used to slower speeds find weird crooked parking jobs inexplicably used to better car smart lift functionality which great car pretty low big overhangs what found take to raise vehicle activates mph less makes little hard to pull steep driveway coming mph road since basically cant yourself down to mph give system enough time to raise up having to enter driveway provide added comfort working steep angles come across lower speeds like taycans blind spot sensors found to little conservative theres times stay car could entering blind spot its actually in blind spot made little hard to aggressive sometimes want to in traffic in found taycan to plenty practical day to day use nearly much compromise from tesla experience thought would techev stuff pretty good writeups comparing taycan to model performance writeup talking recent taycan roadtrip which found in post history dont want to belabor every little ev tech nuance however general impressions owning vehicle cars range indicator feels accurate reliable yes car mile epa range thats real world miles versus say tesla miles somehow become miles range quickly taycan likes to dump battery pretty aggressively driven hard easier to drive efficiently old tesla tesla wouldnt dump battery aggressively driven hard never felt quite comfortable driving efficiently highway taycan non tesla fast charging completely sucks theres enough charging stalls in nontesla networks many ev owners use their free ea charging their primary means charging opposed to road trip use case scenario feel like lack onepedal drive from porsche continued insistence including macan ev assume cayman ev to complete silliness car would much comfortable easier to drive its inclusion being used to porsches lighter regen modes blended regen braking lack one pedal drive isnt completely dire though know porsche lot talk wanting to control car dynamically reason including one pedal driving honestly think make mode called comfort gives one pedal driving softens everything up completely normal sport sports plus modes cant one pedal driving curated porsche driving experience wifes bolt euv steering wheel paddle added regen coming to spot could really good solution introducing controlled one pedal driving experience to porsche drivers car intelligent recuperation mode apply regen always stay certain distance behind car unfortunately mode never seems to lock onto car in front appropriately seems to stop working second car in front starts to come to complete stop mode worked stop would great solution having one pedal driving right its inconsistent turn slow twisty road traffic dont expect to stop time soon whatever reason taycan automatically lock walk away from vehicle lock pressure sensors door handles key fob find exclusion to pretty baffling in day age trained pretty well to lock car manually wish phone app would alert car unlocked certain period time kind miss tesla in go out forget mentality busy days reason car seems to lose its ambient light setting every days feels like odd software to issues instances pcm booted up mode briefly displayed like autoblip ice options in vehicle page ice pcm software car feels like complete silliness to phone app isnt far drop from teslas its little clunky find lot functionality to present however app likes to report windows rolled down likewise wish app ability to give notifications like car unlocked doors left open etc in day to day driving theres basically difference in charging habits taycan model drive quite bit feel like basically charging roughly intervals throughout week road trips feel like basically stopping taycan roughly spots id want to stop tesla notable charging difference two tesla fast charging experience being x better nontesla experience worried day to day range taking step backwards coming from tesla far its nonissue driving experience driven quite obtainable sports cars always generally look perfect vehicle lot vehicles start great drive luster wears start to realize vehicles limitations lot sports cars theres compromise in day to day living practicality starts to add up lot dailyable vehicles theres lack character specialness which makes start lusting sports car drive taycan like think its one first true around compromise cars driven in day to day use car supremely comfortable air suspension makes feel like almost gliding along road car isolated from wind nvh its like in little bubble comfort want to start driving spiritedly car basically turns itself sport car great combo feeling competent accessible safe fun time in c stingray which would characterize fairly easy car to drive quickly in would always hit point car would fun speeds higher next level fun meant being dangerous taking risks shouldnt taking public road often meant would to back sake being responsible always felt like level enjoyment in c could never reached public road in taycan push envelope fun lot further without feeling like being dangerous completely irresponsible range fun in taycan bit broader feel like actually quite bit out car isnt to say taycan capable car c anything like c lot performance character thats hidden away track use taycan somehow allows to bring lot performance out street what really stood out to feel like in vehicle wouldnt feel safe in cars throwing corners stupid speeds being aggressive throttle brake inputs etc think lot to rear wheel steer active roll bars suspension magic car really makes difference in what feel confident in car tried whole slow car fast in elise think taycan delivers much rewarding experience together its fast engaging controllable safe precise time whats interesting feel cars weight in normal driving situations really start to push twisty technical road inputs setup in way helps car mask its weight would say car worst higher speed sweepers extra weight means feel gs youd feel in in lighter car technical roads suspension magic hides weight well highway extra weight turns stability confidence think biggest compliment give taycan driven car basically roads old c legitimately feel like missing anything in terms performance enjoyment compared to c yes experience little different c fun in ways engine noise being able to take top down etc in taycan every day bring people canyon road etc fact taycan delivers c levels street enjoyment in something practical astounding to what particularly like taycan being able to drive in normal setting finding interesting stretch road throwing sports plus blasting down stretch returning to normal second road traffic takes away ability to drive spiritedly to its like being in something close to ease tesla time being able to turn clike driving experience whenever want to its best lot worlds in one vehicle thats cool to experience conclusion tldr yes know long post one car think taycan one best around cars out looks like special vehicle reasonable level practicality best handling experienced thus far above cars properly fast think car great steering feel its sheer competence precision creates rewarding driving experience coming from tesla model performance personally feel like little compromise aside from having to deal nontesla charging network having owned one perceived value vehicle anywhere near high porsches pricing dont necessarily think cars worth k given build quality issues two generation old tech would recommend buying one msrp unless happen to great lease deal which seems doable depending model time year etc good news depreciation huge its uncommon to lightly used cpo car k msrp think thats move strong car enthusiast think ev properly scratch enthusiast itch bmws cars compromised ice platforms ev tech shoved hyundai ioniq n souped up crossover mercedes vehicles look like garbage teslas soulless fall apart lucids dont look sporty enough to really emotional connection regardless competent theres supposed to lot enthusiast evs dropping in nearing end feel like lot manufacturers havent announced anything available soon cayman ev course first properly viable sportsenthusiast ev available announced manufacturers put something else table see taycan being best enthusiast ev next couple years dont want to say its better sporty ice vehicles out honestly scratched itches car enthusiast dont find consistently browsing cargurus next buy thanks to having vehicle in garage

feels worse in blazer likewise interior major downgrade from lyriq really upgrade equinox theres stiching doors its softish plastic fake leather dash feels similar buttons to equinox id say its like nicer hud slightly larger vehicle equinox want stretch lyriq slightly used one price first thought given rs badge would sporty one zero steering feel poor pedal feel numb acceleration could forgive

unnaturally high second seat couldnt really find comfy seating position seat way down felt like head almost touching roof tall third bezels around infotainment absurdly large feels like old timey tv massive box around apparently fixed in model year refresh its frustrating becasue ioniq which saw bezel issue wasnt bad know its bad clearly took awhile to fix dont mind imo best value cant tesla model y sr another similar casualty to blazer ioniq its awful although find interior to pretty bad price model highland fixes issues current model y being cheaper id really strongly recommend waiting whatever model y update drivetrain wise pretty good tesla good one pedal driving like previously falls apart interior quality found fake wood real felt really bad to touch hard time adjusting air vents in pleasing way which annoying seats uncomfortable merged headrest felt awful awhile economy car whatever given configuration available purchase new lr cad expect better otherwise think its okay price useable competition really id nearly impossible to models like ioniq supply caught up new models exist like know tesla better great product in form model highland chevrolet equinox chevy hit in making market well car next vehicle cards table offer criticism ui works fine concerns overblown its bit slow worst looking volvo means something thats disappointing pd isnt super smooth its less bad blazer otherwise ill say car provides value good range okay charging speeds good enough car close enough everything except range isnt really class leading price together makes great package biggest complaint id like to denounce chevy exec who gave inch rims looks ridiculous like child wearing their fathers shoes hey people who yes id love worse ride quality worse fuel economy ill apologize victim honestly want to try hypermile genuinely think knocked down to could hit high tesla model sr highland tesla apple cars love dont sort feeling one way another spiritual android user swallow dislike theres lot to like every material issue model y basically solved better materials better comfort feels quieter already great ui somehow faster better k cad rwd standard range provides whole bunch value km range good charging access to tesla network obviously ventilated seats issue comes down to monoscreen dont like its issue driving dont find aesthetically pleasing like tonnes value like dont care layout bmw ever hear phrase jack trades master none better jack master one bmw to tee nothing really crazy in terms hp theres faster cars out god come together in fundamentally great package owner car enthusiasts encouraged to really give gas whatever great took awhile really gave imo could feel weight around ths frankly dont think id ever regularity remaining ths great reason wouldnt recommend its pricey man literally every possible option down to full leather seats special paint near k in mentioned offhandedly his wife sat in loved new ix bought went to pick his new up years back assume hes good money damn pricey years bmw depreciation though madon fantastic used vehicle nissan ariya who in theory ariya isnt bad vehicle its rather nice actually comfortable interior smooth powertrain nice touchpoints roomy feels like much larger vehicle issue its top trim nearly cad used to simplified trim differences used to hit small battery option in mid gets progressively expensive what justifies super fast charging like ioniq major range really brand appeal nissan seemed to make murano equivalent never see muranos see rogues needed leaf varient rogue styling didnt deliver saw one sale today advertised cash hood says everything imo topped out say think thatd fair enough find local nissan dealership awful to talk based sisters experience thats necessarily nissans fault volvo ex know gene people makes cilantro taste like soap thats volvo either gene makes love volvo dont happen to ill try objective powertrain fantastic its smooth in way hyundai tesla their pedal driving feel everything feels fantastic steering tight driving fast instantly becoming light manuverable low speeds great sound system in cheap harmen kardon option versus bo incredibly comfortable seats volvo often well downside series series feels like super plush in terms touchpoints seats textile blend feels nice enough its clearly first gen product its electric xc infotainment system needs work its slow menu hell generally pain like its nice ignore flaws buy used lease wait new ex to come out polestar car would win improved in single year cycle its polestar drove first came out good baffled decisions lots gloss black plastic options leather fake leather seats fwd series competitior god turned around rwd nappa leather ventilated seats next year getting rid gloss black in cabin really never seen company respond quickly to criticism remaining issue in terms design liked old grilles better new ones cant everything great steering great steering feel great handling around corners huge style its trying to ape like cockpit almost shockingly cramped in front car huge transmission tunnel its styled almost like its trying to look bigger actually screen buttons ui great acceptable to cheap out soc laggy unacceptable especially price point say dont like polestar like lot clearly round one product polestar genuinely concerned their future specifically trying to porsche competitor think good simply built polestar next gen platform to take fight to bmwaudimercedes think would much successful having polestar cayenne competitor need to target xqglc market point

always stems from criticism particular investment goes up in price newer paying higher price hence must ponzi going to blow minds little bit almost legitimate investments require new investors willing to pay higher price older investors to cash out profit investable objects regardless what underlies object trade price market means margin percentage usually small percentage total available supply object trading hands trade priced typically in local fiat currency necessarily to case prices determined supply demand investable object goes up in price market means sellers object lower price price goes up next marginal seller decides willing to part object higher price use term investable object intentionally left extremely broad essentially means anything quantifiable owned traded includes contracts stocks bonds physical objects digital objects etc example bought st edition charizard dollars came out in since relatively abundant being printed company pokemon relatively new time supply high demand low fast forward years pokemon super popular st edition charizards remaining out print decades many lost destroyed years able to sell charizard dollars to guy pokemon card collecting congratulations bought low sold high what participated in ponzi scheme old investor made profit selling to new investor really hope answer to think answer yes stop reading dont think anything going to say beyond point going to help next step in logic realizing charizard example essentially investment returns made investable object hand providing direct flow cash true nondividend which vast majority stocks derivatives physical collectibles like pet rocksbeanie babiestulip bulbs digital collectibles like ingame skinsnftscryptocurrencies etc examples cash flowing investments would dividend stocks direct ownership small businesses net profits available to rental properties important to note ultimately supply demand determine price investable object goes up time underlying reason investable object demand wildly different from object to object reason people want first edition charizards usually different reason people want to stock company within eye investor to decide reason good reason hopefully reason leads to increased demand in future what ponzi according to chatgpt ponzi scheme fraudulent investment scam promises high returns little risk to investors scheme relies using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors rather generating legitimate profit from actual investments business activities eventually scheme collapses becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors many existing investors try to withdraw their money time seems like pretty good definition to part focuses thinking ponzi part scheme relies using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors sounds extremely similar to charizard example yet hope intellectual honesty to accept real ponzi scheme different from buying low selling high part extremely important in addition to old investor returns being funded new investors scheme promises return reality many ponzi schemes start ponzi schemes sometimes investment funds partake briefly in ponzilike behavior to paper potential insolvency during downturn return to legitimate investment activities market improves quite risky illegal arent able to essentially deliver underpromise future returns to out essentially stuck in endless cycle repaying old investors who cash out newer investor money turning legitimate investment fund ponzi scheme right move to always open honest what returns able to achieve investors to avoid being stuck in ponziloop described another attribute ponzi schemes ponzis almost always violently collapse perceived value fund goes down ponzi stops attracting new money becomes apparent quickly liabilities fund far outstrip assets example imagine hypothetical ponzi scheme ponzi fund initially accepted dollars from eager investors in local town fund manager promises annual yield in years time original investors withdraw please unfortunately manager really sucks operating ponzi year obtains exactly zero new clients his liabilities end year cash hand unfortunately taylor swift announced to coming to town tickets sale tickets incidentally cost his investors want to cash out immediately ask their money back first come to able to their money back x th person comes back realizes theres promised fund basically money left owes th person notifies police unfortunate fund manager arrested fraud note in example scheme required investors to withdraw scheme to collapse examples in history tend to much skewed small withdrawal investors completely collapse scheme returning to investable object definition ponzi runs out new investors to pay prior investors investable object completely disappears fund thought flush desirable investable objects could sold open market hopefully higher originally paid actually negative cash balance entire time behind curtain actually object in contrast to buy low sell high example charizard card charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow market price drops from to collectively realizes pokemon super lame yugioh superior card game end day two truths investable object aka charizard one promised return owning always wait out hoping people become interested in charizards pokemon hope somewhat lengthy piece helpful in elucidating ponzi schemes anyone read far often see clearly nonponzi investable objects being echochambered ponzis reddit really stems from misunderstanding investable object mechanics investment itself investable object trades open market nominal gains made price increases due to supply demand dynamics almost certainly ponzi nobody promising return probably isnt ponzi mean investable object itself scam bubble determination made best judgment fundamentals underlie object itself leave final examples to illustrate example tesla stock neither ponzi trades open market scam actually sell cars batteries etc profit might bubble think companys market cap high what its future profits example nikola stock ponzi stock traded open market scam ceo lied to investors functional cars werent many sold pretty much zero

changing fast would like to conversation posted something another sub one members community suggested would better received decided to give shot one tldr people let jump right to question negative sentiment around trump impacts his new tariffs translate to meaningful negative sentiment around teslas stock enough to make specifically diverge from rest mag bearish elon escaped yet using astronomical power his erdf bullish looking something to read go obviously tariffs pain global pain great interview wellrespected economist david rosenberg economist david rosenberg trump admin people dont understand what tariff who want to watch whole video tldw summary trump administration used grade pumpkin math to determine what calling reciprocal tariffs side note american former ice hockey player spent time in canada to say friggin love canadians humor guy starts out sarcastic jab somebody out cracked code blahaha sending good vibes to friends up north keep chins up friends people numb to nonsense coming out trump administration ignoring anymore key to question to postulate shortcovering rally totally ignoring future uncertainty uncertainty priced in what surely uncertainty coming hence negative market reaction uncertainty negatively affects expectations markets trade expectations uncertainty alone knock gdp which modeled proven factor alone lead to zero growth drive us recession sycophants call psychopants instead think tariffs going to work in way being presented surely inflationary exporters pay tariffs importer us tariffs sustainable especially america last price shock from pandemic saw price shocks feed wages case anymore little guy screwed lose jobs pay higher prices america consumerbased economy dont manufacture much anything buy spend money like tomorrow consumers hunker down economy contract screwing ourselves mckinley tariffs like longstanding tariffs recessionary drivers in long run known administration being used strongarming negotiation tactic likely hopefully temporary situation months years guess good mine americans short attention spans election cycles manufacturing business long timecycles lots patience nobody going to anything dust settles tax cuts going to tough to pull conflicting fiscal policy retaliation coming uncertainty cause market volatility rosenberg thinks heading recession priced in able to avoid stave bear markets last two times selloff half done in his view one add tariffs surely cause inflation trump cant bully companies eating losses inflation going to help fed lower rates higher rates really screw companies need to borrow lot money their profits share price markets in which traded lowering rates priced in raising rates seems to flying directly in face one trumps openly stated economic objectives contradictory actions adding to uncertainty around administrations haphazard policy plans rather lack thereof started writing out points from perspective engineer years design development manufacturing experience in america decided to delete slammed tldr comments nobody cared decades nobody cares became rant out frustration from seeing slow death manufacturing in america rampant rise in consumerism dangers poses to economy nation whole share nothing would love to see manufacturing return to beloved country think current actions from administration fail to accomplish fully expect exact opposite effect in long run from direct industry experience foresee tariffs haphazard manner in which being rolled out being far likely to great benefit to china in near term long run america back to item above world tuned out to what going in political theater in america clown show chainsaw wielding theatrics part yesterday shit real entire globe elon certainly become human lightning rod politically motivated people around world part nobody else cared neither wall street analysts institutional buyers looking tesla buying opportunity right potential brand destruction largely ignored merely commented possibility managed realize perspective might anger elon haters trying to objective look chart magnificent mag last months month mag chart normalized gainloss tesla in blue lot changed in three days since made chartpost political activists cheering tesla stock fallen greatly from its recent highs take different yes trump bump erased normalize percent gainloss tesla settled right back in mag in fact tesla one mag stocks in red last month period its best out whole group viewing big shoulder shrug meh from markets harm foul say market might see shortterm tailwinds from benefits being close ally key member trump team anymore seems to importantly despite endless slew terrible news consistently poor fundamental performance long predated recent political turmoil missed expectations last out quarters double digits markets definitely arent pricing in possible negative effects from elons political involvement either like tariffs brief huge positive divergence return to normal tesla seen real damage to its share price in comparison to mag its net zero move elon tesla moment being objective dont mad mad elon know elon tesla fan club members going to jump in say something like elon selling future world robotaxi optimus robot what company being valued right cathy wood says tesla share in years discussion vaporware nonsense huge topic something looking to fact already selfdriving taxis road waymogoogle already humanoid robot assistant developed major car company asimohonda nobody cared either development product launch nobody care elons much delayed cobbled together versions its theatrical diversion from failing car company known tesler like today tesla car company nothing else sale buy stock hype want its part elon reality distortion field erdf lets specific tesla car company derives half its income from nothing to its cars arent selling which cannot control future which volatile half teslas reported profits derived from vapor in form carbon credits crypto trump already away b in funding from greenhouse gas reduction fund ggrf long tesla loses its carbon credits contradiction uncertainty trump cant support tesla simultaneously dismantling government funding support green initiatives promised his voters would prediction trump make positive remarks being friendly to crypto right teslas upcoming earnings call to give his buddy elon bump ready sake discussion lets take fan club perspective paint rosiest picture possible lets say elon finally delivers everything promised years which wont his taxi robot consumer products cars tesla makes recent sales show already real brand destruction going tesla vehicle sales especially outside america gamble seems to elon his team think world bunch stupid goldfish forget his recent antics fringe political craziness go back to buying his junk cars fall apart left outside possibly love done little people world seeing real lasting brand destruction wouldnt consumers teslas customer currently in future boycott elons taxis robots like his cars wouldnt logic risk factors apply to future products company valuation arent being applied to company right seems logical to teslas vehicle sales declining due to poor consumer sentiment around brand his future products would follow trend priced in anyone literally one single analyst intuitional investor applied logic behold power erdf must mention following really important to keep in mind sentiment around tesla brand sentiment around tesla stock two nothing to reality in past way stock prices moves buying selling to stock matter mad people might elon werent holding shares cant anything companys stock price protests directly cause stock prices to move election number people out despising loving elon tesla nothing to stock price unless buying selling shares takes massive institutional investors loyal fan club to prop up stock send higher teslas stock roughly split two havent read reports retail investors going bonkers tesla keep eye out institutional investors report end month one swedish firm closed their entire position tesla may follow one truism keep in mind dont mess peoples money arent politics love trump rightwinged groups elon supporting around globe getting kicked in wallet isnt going to make anyone happy nobody going to spared global markets fed right peoples money people arent in markets real jobs getting destroyed everywhere right elon himself driving up unemployment orchestrating mass firings in government his doge effort alone resulted in hundreds thousands jobs being suddenly lost counting might make much overall difference people retirement accounts fed markets people being put out work certainly arent going to spending like tomorrow putting money markets anymore people being put out jobs in countries tariffs wont putting money markets either government job cuts tariff induced cuts going to small number people being put out work prices everything going up real soon its going to make worse contradictory initiatives rolling out time from administration its like ripping bandaid cutting yourself time tesla elon elon tesla brand inseparable from man himself people didnt care bullshit happening in america many americans themselves certainly rude awakening last couple days trump elected president world leader elon coincidentally elon timed his departure from trump team right tariffs imposed elon really leaving his role already know in media stepping away returning to his many roles his many companies sneaking out back door building burns down might good enough markets to keep believing in tesla questions become elon easily separable from trump really bunch dumb goldfish pumped to jump robotaxi really launched in months seems to what priced in to teslas stock in eyes world which watching their retirement accounts gets decimated jobs cut prices everything to soon rising elon remain tethered to trump specifically pertains to investing negative sentiment around trump impacts his new tariffs translate to meaningful negative sentiment around teslas stock enough to make specifically diverge from rest mag bearish elon escaped yet using

full tank every morning used chevy bolt tesla less k almost anywhere in us qualify k tax credit great vehicles completely cover driving needs obviously theres plenty vehicles higher prices thats need to hear go assess situation always buy car suits needs trucks construction work vans families etc evs different ask yourself additional questions to determine which ev right first important question place to charge main benefit ev owners cite vehicle refuel home every night in contrast worst part experience public charging superchargers which widely considered reliable easiest to use network charging takes longer refueling gas almost always eliminates cost savings from getting rid gas its less common charge work public area like shopping center regularly visit whats normal daily mileage much battery need almost full batterypowered evs bevs miles range point could look plugin hybrid ev phevs fit specific usecase short daily use home charging regular longer road trips although having complex vehicle retains maintenance gas engine many much drawback bevs becoming capable plan to use vehicle to regularly travel to certain destination miles away like weekend ski trip family in another state use apps like plugshare better route planner abrp to plot out trips see what public charging available almost nowhere in us completely inaccessible to evs anymore places much less convenient another way to ask previous question another vehicle in household gas vehicle in cases indisputably better long distance travel compared to ev decide vehicle ever charge home outside emergencies completely ignore fast charging rates which relatively difficult to research understand calculators online to determine much youll save fuel switching to electric obviously depends heavily

bolt leaf egolf from late wont range charging speed model ioniq could save bunch money need to go from garage to work every day unzahn provided additional recommendations research handle needs miles range fast charging needs etc start to actually look cars new to evs contact dealer test drive one asap doesnt matter what kind go try youll never forget first time put pedal to floor in hyundai accelerates like porsche obviously youll price range vehicle preferences heres what know electric side would recommend starting filter range price survey which vehicles in budget meet needs give yourself shortlist start to think particular use case considering following maximum fast charging speed sometimes called dcfc speed ignore plan charging home determines maximum speed fast charger

background title exaggeration actually went every single car trim level available in what tracked amount color options available many included in base price much upgraded colors cost average took months to complete dont want to know many lunch breaks wasted its finally finished dive data wanted to lay out rules used tracking data first rule would track vehicle trim unique set color

kiasoulexblack roof option available in case kia soul separate trims unique paint configurations next rule easier to explain didnt include trim packages in chart would considered special color easiest example hakone edition gr its basically special appearance package available in color didnt want to skew data done discretion its possible trims might sort qualify best to exclude overall final rule something to sake making data complete didnt look ultra luxury vehicles know like ferraris rolls royces come in dozens upon dozens colors cant pricing data ignored brands entirely lastly one final little note start really struggled to figure out good way to include porsche theres pricing data everything available their paint to sample option really hard to fit in chart theres paint to sample options available tremendous cost would heavily skew data porsche models to include since getting pts allocation nigh impossible decided to leave porsche asterisk didnt count pts in final numbers denote available manufacturer data lot intro lets dive right chart below list manufacturer average across their entire line its listed alphabetically take note column showing average costs upgrade

surprises one would expect list made up almost exclusively luxury brands maserati big winner offering almost x many colors average mercedesbenz worth noting though colors come cost average x second

price vehicle alfa in particular nd to maserati in terms free color ratio one final to point out go back look first chart data well see average cost color upgrade across entire industry similar brands whos average premium color cost vast majority automakers fell individual oddities going every single color configurator internet bound to find interesting data points wanted to take found to notable already talked maseratis paint options side coin ram far away cheapest premium color options in industry almost every single ram premium color basically half cost manufacturers cheapest premium color option almost every color offered ram extra fee truck bit wash one made sure to note every single trim whether actual color included in base price forced to pay extra want anything wasnt part
