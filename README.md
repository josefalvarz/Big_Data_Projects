This repository contatains the final examination for the Bg Data & Analytics class in which I served as the leader of my group. 
My team and I are proud to have provided one of the best analyses across all sections of the Big Data class at our University.
As a group, we decided to develop a Tesla sentiment analysis to find out what Tesla's audience is talking about the most.

This project contains two subfolders:

Hadoop - This folder documentates all the work donde to process and clean the data, (more specific aspects are mention inside this folder's READme).
Visualization - This folders contains all the visualization material that we used to explain our analysis, Graphs were made in Tableau and Word Clouds on Python/VADER. More information inside the folder.
Other files - This files are the code that we used to fetch the data from Reddit and code that we used to clean the data, for example separate each field by commas.
