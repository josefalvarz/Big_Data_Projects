Big Data & Analytics – Final Examination Project

This repository contains the final examination project for the Big Data & Analytics class, in which I served as the leader of my group.
My team and I are proud to have delivered one of the best analyses across all sections of the course at our university.

For our project, we developed a Tesla Sentiment Analysis to explore what Tesla’s audience discusses most frequently.
