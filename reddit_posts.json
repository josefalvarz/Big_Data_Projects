    "title": "JayEMM On Cars - The Unbelievable Business Practices of BYD",
    "selftext": "Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBbiCrsk7RM\n\nThe complete title was a bit click-baity so I've trimmed it a bit - but its faithful to the content. The content itself is also a bit ... eager to get views, and so I'm a bit hesitant to share it, but not often do you get first hand experience from journalists dealing with the chinese market like this. \n\nIn summary.\n\n- He received an invite to the UK launch of the BYD sea-lion 7, which asked for his \"rates of collaboration\"\n\n- Paid \"journalism\" is extremely common in China where you are expected to wax lyrical on the companies you work with, with contracts forbidding negative remarks and giving the brand final-cut approval\n\n- This is very obviously contrary to how it is done in the west, where there is an extremely clear distinction between journalism and paid advertisement by so-called influencers. \n\n- He himself turned down a similar offer from JAC earlier this year, and knows others who do accept such offers\n\n- Also raises concerns on human rights issues e.g. BYD getting sued by the Brazilian government for slavery-like conditions at their factory . \n\nBYD themselves in china sued 37 influencers for defamatory comments, has 126 influencers on a watch list, and provides financial incentives up to ~700k for leads on online defamation of the brand. \n\nNow BYD alleges \u201cWe welcome media criticism and public oversight, but we will not tolerate defamatory content or false accusations,\u201d but thats not consistent with their ruling, e.g. a court concluded an influencer was fined after claiming BYD was financially unstable and on the verge of bankruptcy \n\nWhen there are reports to corroborate this e.g. [GMT Research's analysis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-19/byd-s-supply-chain-financing-masks-ballooning-debt-gmt-says) suggested their actual debt is closer to $44 billion and that they are \"addicted\" to supply chain financing - their reported figure is 27.7 billion yuan or ~$4b. \n\nNot exclusive to BYD either \u2013 Huawei did a video a few months prior comparing their Maextro S800 to the Maybach S680, with their own coming out on top, but they were called out by an influencer for deliberately deflating the tires on the MB. Influencer was sued for $140k, and he countersued for $340k. \n\nIMO its somewhere in the middle - having tried a few models here and there the chinese do make some fantastic products, he also mentioned \"I\u2019d be arrested if I set foot in China,\" but foreign journalists are rarely jailed for civil defamation. And while I feel suing under defamation for the financial analysis is unwarranted, hidden leverage is not inherently a red flag and BYD is still profitable, it doesn't prove they are on the verge of bankruptcy. \n\nIn general, I do think he leans a little sensational. There is an element where the Chinese are genuinely leading with tech and most american and european manufacturers use e.g. their batteries. There have also been substantial moves on the ethics side e.g. many products are now using LFP batteries which are free of cobalt. \n\nBut point is it is worth keeping in mind that reviews, even from western reviews for a western audience nowadays, may not be what they seem and it is good to keep an eye out for the fine line between performance and propaganda. \n\nAnd to be clear, that is not exclusive to chinese companies, especially outside of automotive, but its just the topic at hand. Tesla notably sued Top Gear for example, and he mentions their Chinese arm does much of the same as BYD. Its not particularly surprising either to those who have dealt with chinese companies domestically, but doing the same at a worldwide scale is a relatively recent phenomenon.",

    "title": "Where are all the colors. Analysis of every paint option available today.",
    "selftext": "A game I often play on my commute home every day is to try and find color options of cars that I'm particularly fond of. It's a fun time passer, but it's also something that I have found to be somewhat challenging recently. I'm certainly not the first person to notice, but the vast majority of automobiles seem to be homogenizing into the same grayscale paint choices that aim to be as inoffensive as possible.\n\nThis got me thinking about what paint colors and options are even available for the everyday car, and sent me down a rabbit hole that lasted several months. As a bit of a nerd for numbers and statistics, I went through and decided to get some hard data on this to look at, and I want to share that with you all today so we can talk about what I found.\n\n**Intro and Background**\n\nSo the title is not an exaggeration, I actually went through every single car and trim level available in 2025. What I tracked was the amount of color options available, how many of them were included in the base price, and how much the upgraded colors cost on average. This took months to complete and I don't even want to know how many lunch breaks I wasted on this, but it's finally finished. \n\nBefore we dive into the data I just wanted to lay out some of the rules I used when tracking this data. The first rule was that I would track each vehicle and each trim that had a unique set of color combinations. What this meant was if I found a car where 3 trims all had the same color options and pricing, but the 4th trim had separate options/pricing, I would track that as two separate line items on the spreadsheet (making sure to note which trims were in each item). This meant there were some cars that had a ton of different configurations, and the chart has over 730 rows in it. An example of how this works can be seen below.\n   \n|Manufacturer|Vehicle|Trim|Total Paint Options|Free Colors|AVG cost of color upgrade|Percent of Free Colors|Notes|\n:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|Kia|Soul|LX|6|4|$345|66.67%||\n|Kia|Soul|S|8|4|$345|50.00%||\n|Kia|Soul|GT Line|5|3|$345|60.00%||\n|Kia|Soul|EX|7|4|$563|57.14%|Black roof option available|\n\nSo in this case, the Kia Soul had 4 separate trims with unique paint configurations. \n\nThe next rule I had was easier to explain. I didn't include trim packages in the chart that would be considered a \"special\" color only. The easiest example of this is the Hakone edition GR86. It's basically a special appearance package that is available in 1 color, and I didn't want it to skew the data. This was done at my own discretion so it's possible there are a few trims on here that might sort of qualify for that, but I did my best to exclude them overall.\n\nThe final rule was something I had to do for the sake of making the data complete, but I didn't look at any ultra luxury vehicles here. We all know things like Ferrari's and Rolls Royce's come in dozens upon dozens of colors, but because I cant get pricing data I ignored those brands entirely. \n\nLastly one final little note before we start, but I really struggled to figure out a good way to include Porsche here. There's pricing data for everything available, but their paint to sample option was really hard to fit in the chart. There's over 190 paint to sample options available, and all at a tremendous cost. It would heavily skew the data on all of the Porsche models if I were to include it, and since getting PTS allocation is nigh impossible, I decided to just leave Porsche with an asterisk. I didn't count PTS in the final numbers, but I did denote that it was available. \n\n**Manufacturer Data**\n\nThat was a lot of intro so let's just dive right into it. The chart below is a list of each manufacturer and the average across their entire line. It's listed alphabetically. Also take note that the column showing the average costs, of an upgrade does not include any zero values. \n\n|Manufacturer|AVG Color Options|AVG Free colors|AVG Color upgrade cost|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|\n|Acura|5.56|1.50|$600.00|\n|Alfa Romeo|4.73|0.55|$1,203.55|\n|Audi|7.97|1.54|$596.92|\n|BMW|11.31|3.58|$1,810.36|\n|Buick|6.09|2.82|$561.64|\n|Cadillac|6.52|1.24|$886.86|\n|Chevrolet|6.58|4.44|$661.70|\n|Chrysler|4.00|2.00|$495.00|\n|Dodge|6.67|2.00|$508.33|\n|Ford|7.68|4.88|$600.26|\n|Genesis|8.00|1.25|$703.25|\n|GMC|6.04|0.96|$587.04|\n|Honda|6.00|2.86|$455.00|\n|Hyundai|6.24|4.12|$535.12|\n|Infiniti|5.71|2.57|$698.38|\n|Jeep|6.33|0.93|$651.07|\n|Kia|5.85|3.17|$482.81|\n|Land Rover|9.18|2.18|$2,035.85|\n|Lexus|6.56|3.15|$589.81|\n|Lincoln|6.57|1.29|$886.86|\n|Lucid|4.33|1.33|$900.00|\n|Maserati|22.17|2.00|$10,306.17|\n|Mazda|7.57|2.86|$523.00|\n|Mercedes-Benz|13.77|5.69|$3,309.92|\n|Mini|8.00|5.31|$431.25|\n|Mitsubishi|5.50|3.08|$578.27|\n|Nissan|6.13|3.70|$511.72|\n|Porsche|12.30|4.00|$2,319.50|\n|Ram|6.77|1.85|$286.92|\n|Rivian|8.00|1.00|$2,281.00|\n|Subaru|6.37|5.56|$448.54|\n|Tesla|5.17|1.33|$1,726.60|\n|Toyota|5.65|4.02|$483.98|\n|Volkswagen|5.68|4.05|$536.82|\n|Volvo|7.24|7.24|$0.00|\n\nThere's quite a few standouts here to talk about, but first let's just look at the top 10 manufacturers in terms of colors offered. \n\n|Manufacturer|AVG Color Options|AVG Free colors|AVG Color upgrade cost|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|\n|Maserati|22.17|2.00|$10,306.17|\n|Mercedes-Benz|13.77|5.69|$3,309.92|\n|Porsche|12.30|4.00|$2,319.50|\n|BMW|11.31|3.58|$1,810.36|\n|Land Rover|9.18|2.18|$2,035.85|\n|Genesis|8.00|1.25|$703.25|\n|Mini|8.00|5.31|$431.25|\n|Rivian|8.00|1.00|$2,281.00|\n|Audi|7.97|1.54|$596.92|\n|Ford|7.68|4.88|$600.26|\n\nThere aren't many huge surprises here. As one would expect, this list is made up of almost exclusively luxury brands. Maserati was the big winner here, offering almost 2x as many colors on average as the #2 Mercedes-Benz. It is worth noting though that those colors come at a cost of over $10,000 each on average. This is more than 3x the second place brand in terms of pricing. Maserati actually had the most expensive single paint option I found in my research, where they had several colors on the GranTurismo and Gran Cabrio that ran over$18,000.\n\nAnother brand worth mentioning on this chart is Mini, who offer a good selection of colors, at either cheap or free pricing. In fact, on every Mini, if you go for the Iconic trim package, every single color option is free. They do a good job capitalizing on the cutesy nature of their cars and make sure that the fun colors are available for most buyers. \n\nNext I want to look at the brands who did the best job of offering free colors. The first table shows the top 5 brands in terms of how many free colors they offer, and the 2nd shows the top 5 brands in terms of the percentage of colors offered that are free.\n\n|Manufacturer|AVG Color Options|AVG Free colors|Percentage of Free Colors|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|\n|Volvo|7.24|7.24|100.00%|\n|Mercedes-Benz|13.77|5.69|41.34%|\n|Subaru|6.37|5.56|87.21%|\n|Mini|8.00|5.31|66.35%|\n|Ford|7.68|4.88|63.54%|\n\n|Manufacturer|AVG Color Options|AVG Free colors|Percentage of Free Colors|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|\n|Volvo|7.24|7.24|100.00%|\n|Subaru|6.37|5.56|87.21%|\n|Volkswagen|5.68|4.05|71.30%|\n|Toyota|5.65|4.02|71.05%|\n|Chevrolet|6.58|4.44|67.49%| \n\nThe obvious standout here is Volvo. They were such a breath of fresh air when doing this research, as every single color option they offer is free. Volvo also comes in at 12th in terms of colors offered on average, so as far as I'm concerned, they were the biggest winners in this research. \n\nI also want to look at some of the worst offenders here, so let's take a look at the 10 brands who offer the fewest number of paint options.\n\n|Manufacturer|AVG Color Options|AVG Free colors|Percentage of Free Colors|AVG Color upgrade cost|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|Chrysler|4.00|2.00|50.00%|$495.00|\n|Lucid|4.33|1.33|30.77%|$900.00|\n|Alfa Romeo|4.73|0.55|11.54%|$1,203.55|\n|Tesla|5.17|1.33|25.81%|$1,726.60|\n|Mitsubishi|5.50|3.08|56.06%|$578.27|\n|Acura|5.56|1.50|26.97%|$600.00|\n|Toyota|5.65|4.02|71.05%|$483.98|\n|Volkswagen|5.68|4.05|71.30%|$536.82|\n|Infiniti|5.71|2.57|45.00%|$698.38|\n|Kia|5.85|3.17|54.18%|$482.81|\n\nThis is probably the most interesting chart to me, as it's a mix of very different brands that you wouldn't expect to be grouped together. Chrysler, who only makes 1 car is unsurprisingly at the top, but more interestingly is Alfa Romeo, Acura and Infiniti. Luxury brands made up almost all of the top 10 of the brands that did the best job of offering colors, but here we still have 3 luxury automakers that are doing a really poor job at giving choice to their customers. Not only that, but both Alfa and Acura are horrible at even including these colors in the base price of the vehicle. Alfa in particular was 2nd only to Maserati in terms of free color ratio. \n\nOne final thing to point out, if we go back and look at the first chart with all of the data on it, we'll see that the average cost of a color upgrade across the entire industry is very similar. There were only 8 brands who's average premium color cost more than $1000, and the vast majority of automakers fell between $430-$900. \n\n**Individual Oddities**\n\nWhen going through every single color configurator on the internet, you're bound to find some interesting data points. I wanted to take you through a few that I found to be the most notable\n\nWe already talked about Maserati's $18,000 paint options, but on the other side of the coin, Ram had far and away the cheapest premium color options in the industry. Almost every single Ram premium color was between $245-$295. This is basically half the cost of most manufacturers cheapest premium color option. Now almost every color offered by Ram was an extra fee, but $245 on a $50,000+ truck is a bit of a wash.\n\nOne thing I made sure to note on every single trim was whether or not an actual color was included in the base price, or if you were forced to pay extra should you want anything that wasn't part of the grayscale. Of the 734 separate color combinations offered, over 39% of them were only available with grayscale colors for free. I think this is a pretty big factor when you look at why we have so many grey cars on the road, since basically anything that isn't gray white or black is going to cost you an additional $500+. \n\nAnother fun tidbit we can look is the cars with the most color options. The next table is going to show the top 5 cars that have the most factory color options available\n\n|Manufacturer|Vehicle|Trim|Total Paint Options|\n:--|:--|:--|--:|\n|Mercedes-Benz|G-Class|AMG G 63|37|\n|Mercedes-Benz|G-Class|580|34|\n|Land Rover|Range Rover|SE, Autobiography|33|\n|Land Rover|Range Rover|SV|31|\n|Land Rover|Range Rover Sport|Autobiography|31|\n\nNo surprises in terms of the cars here, but the AMG G63 offering 37 different paints is quite impressive. The Range rover SV with it's 31 color options is quite impressive as well, but it's worth noting that of those 31 colors, only 1 is free, and the average cost of those other 30 color options is $8890!!\n\nThe last thing I wanted to talk about is the cars I found with no free colors. There were one or two cars I found that didn't have a single color that was \"included\" in the price. The cars on this list were the Audi SQ5, GMC Sierra 1500 Denali, and Jeep Wrangler 4xe Willys 41. Initially I chalked this up to a clerical error, until I started looking at Alfa Romeo. Every single Alfa Romeo in the Intensa or Quadrifoglio trim, lacked a free color, effectively making their base price a complete lie. The funny part is that this brings Alfa's average free color offerings down so low that it is actually less than 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhew that was a lot. If you made it this far, thank you for reading. This took me a significant amount of time and I appreciate everyone who took the time to read. This was a fun passion project and I'm glad to finally have it completed. I will include a link to the dataset for people to peruse through if they want. \n\nTo wrap up though, what did we learn? Truthfully not that much, very little here was actually all that surprising. I think ultimately this turned into a fun way to compare manufacturers offerings to each other. What stuck out to you the most? \n\n\nLink to data here.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10puoeA67Z1uFK16oifTvSsFLIVM3fc2x/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=107594740030154796775&rtpof=true&sd=true",

    "selftext": "Watching this video that showed up in my YouTube feed:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vfSFmI8PVW8\n\n...I had to chuckle a little. Once a year, I test drive a Tesla for fun, just to check if they've improved and test driving new cars is sort of a hobby of mine anyway. Every Tesla I have ever driven has phantom braked here on our narrow, winding, poorly marked roads in Norway when TACC/cruise control is activated. Every single one. Even the dealer says cruise control only works on highways. Yes, my 20+ years old collectible Hyundai has functioning cruise control...everywhere. \n\nAnyway, what I don't understand is people who buy a car with a **widely known fault** and then blame the manufacturer later on, going as far as joining a class action suit. Kia's explodey engines were not known to every buyer at the time of purchase, but Tesla's phantom braking has *always* followed the brand from when the model S was new. To me, this is like trying to indict Lexus for incoherent aesthetics. You *knew* that.\n\nAm I alone in thinking like this? I understand that, maybe, this is what's needed to make Tesla take responsibility for a poorly designed product and I'm all for it. I just don't understand the buyer's thinking here.",

It\u2019s both a not so subtle challenge and, given that Musk\u2019s antics have transformed from childish to very controversial in the last couple years, it feels somehow significant and welcome that an American EV brand is starting from this message.

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in Brazil for 15 days and love this BYD dolphin. When I first saw it, I did not love the styling, but it\u2019s been an absolute joy. I\u2019ve driven Teslas (model 3 and model y) up and down California numerous times. The BYD feels more luxurious and less cheap in almost every way. \n\n\nI have not experienced a single phantom breaking while in a BYD. I had 3 in one day the last time I drove a Tesla. On the byd, the driver assistance has just worked. \n\n\nThe interior is MUCH better. Tesla seats and interiors feel cheap. The stealing wheels wear quickly due to how thin the material is. I thought a Tesla was quiet due to the lack of ICE, but the BYD has much less road noise on wayyy shittier cobblestone roads. The seats are more comfortable and EVERY surface material feels more less cheap and flimsy.\n\n\nThe car is much more intuitive than a Tesla. The Tesla OS is always a pain to figure out where basic shit is. I had to pull over and watch a YouTube video to figure out how to do something on a road, but have found the dolphin to be very intuitive. The screen also rotates from landscape to horizontal which is nice to watch YouTube. Charging has taken 20-40 minutes each time.\n\n\nOn the whole, the BYD felt like a proper luxury car (think lexus) while the Tesla just felt very cheap and gimmicky. If we could get BYDs in CA, I\u2019d buy one when I got back. The Dolphin plus is R$169k which is under $30k usd.\n\n\nTLDR: the BYD dolphin is surprisingly nice and I want one.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a California lawyer who is passionate about cars. My business / family fleet is currently:\n\n\nRx 350 f sport, Yukon Denali xl, 4Runner, forester xt, mazda 3, Corolla, a 2023 model y, and 2 Tesla model 3s (2019 and 2024). I also have a 68 Pontiac restomod and a 2008 Impreza beater, but those are not really applicable. I semi recently sold my bmw 5 series, Cadillac cts, and 66 mustang restomod.

    "title": "How many of us would be sad if Nissan went under?",
    "selftext": "I know a lot of Reddit loves to clown on Nissan, but at one point they were one of the best in their game. The Y61 Patrol, the 300ZX, the S-chassis Silvias, the R32/33/34 GT-Rs - these were legendary cars, and even their VIP sedans like the Laurel, Cima, Cefiro (especially when the Cefiro was RWD in its first generation,) Cedric, Gloria and the like were great. In the US, the original Pathfinders were 4Runner, Blazer and Discovery competitors, while the Sentra SE-R proved that even compact sedans could be fun - something we see with a lot more of today's compact sedans (like the Elantra N, for example.)\n\nEven into the 2000s, when Nissan was already starting their decline, they put out some bangers - the G35/37 (Skyline) was seen as what the Z buyer got after starting a family - the performance of a sports car with the added practicality of a sedan. The M35/45 (Fuga/Gloria) was a super underrated luxury sedan that offered a compelling alternative to the Lexus GS and a way to get an otherwise-JDM only product in left hand drive. The FX35/45 was a trendsetter in the luxury SUV world - it paved the way for the Porsche Cayenne, Land Rover Range Rover Sport, and other sportier luxury SUVs as well. The 350/370Z were widely celebrated at launch - a sports car for the 21st century, one of the best-handling cars this side of a 911 and a worthy model to carry the iconic badge. And even their regular stuff wasn't half bad - V6 Altimas and Maximas in the USA were sleepers - the V6 Altima had more power than the Camry, Accord or Mazda6, the XTerra was another 4Runner alternative, the Primera was a competitive hatch in Europe, the original X-Trail came from an era when crossovers were still fun and cute and not every other car on the road, and the Elgrand minivan in Japan oozed VIP elegance in that oh-so-JDM way. \n\nNow, the Y62 Patrol is a huge wannabe Range Rover with an oh-so-2000s interior and not the no-nonsense offroader it was - it took the Land Cruiser's move upmarket and made it even more drastic, the R35 GT-R has been in production since 2007 with minimal changes and is no longer the supercar slayer it once was, no manual either, the Silvia is completely dead, the VIP sedans are dead, the Skyline/Q50 has been languishing since 2014, the Altima and Maxima went from 4DSC to rental special/what you get if your credit isn't the best, the Sentra is the epitome of meh, the Pathfinder is now a fat unibody FWD Rogue-based crossover, the XTerra is gone, the FX is gone, and the 370Z remained on sale with minimal changes until 2020. Even the new Z, while it might look new, is still based on the FM platform from *2001* and has a lot of carryover from the 370Z - and thus, the 350Z before it. \n\nBut despite all this, I'm rooting for Nissan, maybe it's because they're an underdog (product wise) compared to the other Japanese giants now, maybe because of nostalgia for old Nissans, maybe because they do offer some legitimately compelling products (like the new Armada or Frontier,) or maybe because I'd rather see a legacy automaker survive than a brand like Elon's nazimobiles thrive. (as for that, those talks about Tesla buying Nissan pissed me off, like I hate that we live in a world where that is even a reality.) So, back to the original question, how many of us would miss Nissan if they were gone? How many of us would be sad if Nissan went under?",

However - cast aluminum is not good for towing as we see in this Cybertruck durability test video. The hitch breaks around 10,000 pounds. (4500kg) Which is far too close to the 11,000 pound towing capacity. Yikes. \n\nSaw the video circulating around reddit with outrage elsewhere, was looking for some discussion. Thousands of valid reasons to hate the cybertruck and the company behind it, but unless I am missing something it seems like the cybertruck did quite good here no? He put pretty much pure tongue load on that hitch, the tongue weight rating on this is 1,100lbs from tesla, and it only failed @ 10,000lbs, nearly 10x. \n\nJustification given for the test in the video was that with improper loading or an impact trailer weight can/will be converted to tongue weight, but I feel that is user error and under similar circumstances the rivian wouldn't fare particularly well either. I think SAE standard here its 50% GVWR x/y and 150% z, which it would pass fine. \n\nCould argue that the failure mode isn't ideal as demonstrated in the whistlindiesel video, and the properties of aluminum aren't ideal for a truck & perhaps we will see failure over time, but it seems to me like he proving tesla's engineering right here? (and as an aside, his explanation of fatigue limit was backwards). Same thing with the glue, modern 3M panel bond & similar adhesive hold up just as well & often better than welding, cars are full of structural adhesives. \n\nI don't really get the point of the video, nor the \"yikes\" response, I feel content like this takes away from the hundreds of real issues with these products.\n\nEdit: I am still confused, there are plenty of folks in the reply going he pointed out the obvious / proved its overpriced / its not good at doing real work / he explained it in the video, but didn't he prove the opposite, that the truck is capable of handling what it is rated for and more? And that his explanation/justification is far above what SAE requires? Am I missing something? Genuine question.",

My other options were Honda, Mazda, maybe BMW and Renault. Like, why choose Mazda or Honda over VW or a far larger brand or even Tesla? Because VW is boring to me and I hated Tesla before it was cool, being a tech is very much about passion because you really do need it in order to get good, learning a lot in a little at the start otherwise it's like pulling teeth. \n\nAlso having a performance car helps show a car company isn't just \"adequate\". The Kia Stinger and Hyundai I30 N are the apex of this effect. Both showed that South Korea companies could make great cars and legitimatised them as a actual car manufacturer worth paying attention to. So many people were surprised about just how good they are, overnight Hyundai went from a literal joke in The Sopranos and Tokyo Drift to being seen as just as good as the rest. I30 N production was shut down quite quick but that's because, it did its job, people get a lot of advice about cars from people they know who like cars, so Hyundai or Kia was no longer a dirty word. Now that they're moving into EVs, people see them as a real player, a valid choice to buy from.",

    "selftext": "I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the idea that all of these \"tax credits\" are part of the \"go green\" initiative. \n\nMost EV's, are 50k+, pre - tax credit. Anyone who can afford a 50k vehicle, doesn't need a $7,500 state plus potentially similar state incentive. \n\nTesla is a great example. (And before all of \"nazi/elon haters\" chime in, take a deep breathe. For years the government gave them billions of dollars. Tesla also earned zero emissions tax credits to which they sold (to makers like FCA, GM, etc). Which raked in billions of dollars. \n\nNow, take New Jersey for example, BEV's (battery electric vehicles) used to qualify for zero sales tax. Now they're phasing in sales tax and have also added an egregious registration fee. If the people, government, and society 'really' cared about the environment, why aren't we putting forth programs that address the dinosaurs on the road today. \n\nThe average age of a vehicle on the road today, in the US, is 12.4 years. AVERAGE. Would it not make sense to subsidize these vehicles with a $7,500 incentive for people who have owned their car for longer than 5 years, and make less than 75k/yr, to entice them to get into a newer vehicle that has more efficient technology and better emissions? Layer in cars with 100k+ miles. \n\nI know many friends and family who have had 3 or 4 EV's over the last couple of years and dipped into these tax credits several times. In some cases, making $500k+ and leasing a car to get the credit and then buying it out shortly there after. \n\nEV's aren't holding their value, the sales figures seem fake and not realistic to natural demand. And if we actually cared about the environment, going green, and global warming, we could use these tax programs to really impact older cars on the road today. \n\nTLDR: why are incentivizing EV's with tax credits and wild pricing schemes, for people who can afford 50k+ vehicles, and not focusing on the average car in the US at 12.4 years old, for those people to get newer cars that are more efficient?\n\n",

    "selftext": "**TLDR: Auto show kinda sucks now and i probably won\u2019t go back**\n\n\nWe used to go to the car show every year but we stopped attending because every year it got more and more watered down. Decided to go this year for old times sake and it was disappointing. \n\n\nThe area for the manufacturers cars was like ~1/3rd what it used to be with tons of brands being completely absent. Basically no luxury or EV brands. The rest of the space was taken by vendors and the (bigger than it used to be) custom car section. The overwhelming majority of cars I wanted to see were absent. Probably won\u2019t go back, and if the new Charger hadn\u2019t been there I probably would\u2019ve called the day wasted tbh. Went with one of my parents and basically nothing they wanted to see was there. \n\n\nMore detailed thoughts: \n\n\n* The main car I wanted to see in person was the EV Charger and props to Dodge it was right near the entrance. \n\n\n* Jeep has had some variation of an indoor track with a steep hill you drive over every year I\u2019ve gone and they had it here again. Love it\n\n\n* Ford\u2019s exhibit was insanely basic. No 2 door Bronco, no Raptors, no Lobo, no Dark Horse, no Mach-E Rally, etc. \n\n\n* Subaru had a good exhibit. The BRZ tS was locked, which is funny because the WRX tS was right next to it and had full access despite being more expensive. They also had a good spread of base vehicles and a couple Wilderness models. Even had a Solterra. \n\n\n* Toyota had the whole GR lineup all 3 cars in red and unlocked full public access. They also had a neat row of tablets with live configurators and even a nice sitting/rest area.\n\n\n* Cadillac didn\u2019t try at all, though ig they get props for being the only luxury brand to even show up. One base Escalade covered in smudges and a couple basic EVs, with no brand reps that I saw.\n\n\n* Nissan had a bunch of cars, a trivia game with a Lego GTR prize, and some other contest giveaway. The Z was there, though you had to wait in a line and fill out a survey to get to it. The wait wasn\u2019t long and it was nice being able to look at the car alone. \n\n\n* According to the map Tesla was there but apparently the exhibit was small because I walked right past where it was and don\u2019t remember seeing them.\n\n\n* The vending section was full of random crap like cheap jewelry and energy drinks \n\n\n* Ineos was there surprisingly. Unsurprisingly their entire section was gated off lol.\n\n\n* There was a section for movie cars. Saw the DeLorean and the truck from Twister. Neat side exhibit.\n\n\n* I hated the custom car section. Slammed enthusiast car with aftermarket wheels x100\n\n\n* The last time I went (and the reason we stopped going) tons of basic economy cars were gated off and often the latest models weren\u2019t even there. Credit where it\u2019s due this was not the case this year\u2026with very few exceptions if they brought the car you could interact with it, and everything I saw was a current model.",

    "title": "My review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long road trip ",
    "selftext": "A review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long road trip. \n\nA review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long loaner\n\nI recently had the BMW iX M60 for a week as a loaner. I have driven most of the EVs out there, including another week long road tripper (the Mercedes EQS), currently own a Hyundai IONIQ 6, a BMW X5 and BMW M3. I decided to provide some info about my experience road tripping this iX M60 for a week and 700 miles with my family over the Christmas holiday while my wife\u2019s X5 was in the shop. \n\nSpoiler: not terribly impressed! \n\nI did use ChatGPT to format this review a bit nicer and closer to a more traditional automotive review, hope no one is too upset but your reading experience is much improved trust me. \n\n2024 BMW iX M60: A Mixed Bag of Innovation and Compromise\n\nThe BMW iX M60 enters the crowded luxury EV market with the promise of blending BMW\u2019s trademark driving dynamics with cutting-edge electrification. Positioned as a performance-oriented alternative to the likes of the Mercedes EQS SUV and Tesla Model X, the iX M60 seeks to redefine what a premium electric SUV can be. Yet, after a week of real-world testing, including a 700-mile road trip, it\u2019s clear that the iX is both a showcase of BMW\u2019s engineering prowess and a reminder of where the brand\u2019s EV journey still falls short.\n\nCharging Woes: A Pain Point for the Price\n\nFor an EV that commands a base price north of $112,000, charging performance is a glaring weakness. The iX M60\u2019s advertised fast-charging capability of up to 195kW seems promising on paper, but in practice, it struggles to maintain consistent speeds. Over the course of our trip, the vehicle averaged an underwhelming 90kW at 350kW-capable stations, often dropping to 135kW or lower within minutes. This resulted in 40-minute waits to charge from 20% to 80%, a frustrating reality in a segment where faster charging curves are becoming the norm.\n\nComparatively, the Mercedes EQS and Hyundai IONIQ series\u2014vehicles at vastly different price points\u2014both outperformed the iX in charging efficiency and curve stability. BMW\u2019s focus on \u201cmiles per minute\u201d metrics, rather than charging speeds, subtly acknowledges this limitation. While the iX offers respectable range accuracy, its slow charging dampens its usability on longer trips. These two other EVs will be the primary comparison against the iX M60 throughout this review as they are the two which I have also road-tripped and lived with for extended periods of time. \n\nDriving Dynamics: Power Meets Bulk\n\nThe iX M60\u2019s 610 horsepower and 811 lb-ft of torque deliver blistering straight-line speed, particularly from a standstill. Yet, despite this power, the SUV\u2019s 5,800-pound curb weight makes itself known in high-speed situations, where acceleration tapers off noticeably beyond 80 mph. The vehicle\u2019s low ground clearance contributes to a planted feel, but the added heft becomes apparent in sharp corners and during braking, diminishing the agility typically associated with BMW\u2019s M-badged vehicles.\n\nSteering feedback, while precise, is devoid of engagement, but that\u2019s to be expected in a vehicle of this class. The air suspension system helps maintain composure over uneven surfaces and allows for adjustable ground clearance, though the lack of intermediate settings between \u201cminimum\u201d and \u201cmaximum\u201d is limiting.\n\nInterior: A Clash of Style and Substance\n\nThe iX M60\u2019s interior is a mix of modern design and questionable execution. The materials, while visually appealing, falter in tactile quality. The Sensatec upholstery feels out of place in a vehicle at this price point, and build quality issues\u2014including persistent creaks and rattles emanating from the center vents and infotainment mounting points\u2014were disappointing in a loaner with just 2,800 miles on the odometer.\n\nPracticality is another sore spot. Storage space, an area where SUVs typically excel, is limited in the iX. Unlike competitors which make great use of the lack of a transmission tunnel to add more storage in the cabin, the iX does not and instead leaves a blank floor to have objects roll around on. Odd decisions, such as the use of piano black trim on the center console\u2014an area prone to fingerprints and scratches\u2014further detract from the overall experience. On the positive side, the driver\u2019s seating position is excellent, and visibility is commendable for a vehicle of this size.\n\nTechnology: A Highlight with Caveats\n\nBMW\u2019s technological suite is a standout feature in the iX. The augmented reality navigation system, which overlays directional prompts onto a live video feed, is genuinely useful in unfamiliar urban settings. Camera systems are seamless and responsive, elevating the driving experience in tight spaces.\n\nHowever, some features fail to impress. The Auto Backup Assistant is notably less refined than its counterpart in the Mercedes EQS, offering only limited functionality. The iDrive 8.5 interface is robust but hindered by a convoluted menu structure that places frequently used settings within a library of \u201capps.\u201d Voice recognition has improved significantly, providing a more intuitive alternative to manual adjustments.\n\nSound Design: A Novelty Worn Thin\n\nBMW\u2019s collaboration with Hans Zimmer to create \u201cIconic Sounds\u201d adds a unique auditory dimension to the iX\u2019s otherwise silent driving experience. While the futuristic tones enhance initial impressions, they quickly lose their novelty. By the end of the first day, the synthetic sounds were turned off, allowing the iX\u2019s excellent sound insulation to shine instead. \n\nAnother poorly-performing component of the interior technology was the massaging seats which are significantly worse and less comfortable than the ones found in the Mercedes EQS. \n\nFinal Thoughts: An Ambitious Yet Flawed Contender\n\nThe 2024 BMW iX M60 is a vehicle of contradictions. It excels in urban environments, where its quiet demeanor, technological sophistication, and rapid acceleration shine. However, as a long-distance EV, it stumbles. Slow charging speeds, subpar efficiency, and an uninspiring driving experience at higher speeds tarnish its appeal, particularly when compared to rivals like the Mercedes EQS and even the more affordable Hyundai IONIQ series. \n\nThe iX M60\u2019s interior craftsmanship and material choices also leave room for improvement, especially at this price point. While the exterior design grows on you, and thoughtful touches like carbon fiber add a sense of occasion, the overall package feels more like a work in progress than a fully realized flagship EV.\n\nFor those seeking a luxury EV with striking aesthetics and cutting-edge tech, the iX M60 delivers in parts. But for a true all-rounder, better options exist within the segment. \n\nPictures:\n\nCharging at the new IONNA Rechargery just opened in Apex, NC. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/XGfdKXq.jpeg\n\nInterior\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hBJeQkp.jpeg\n\nAnother shot from inside the Rechargery with the iX sitting at the charger.

    "title": "The tariffs against Chinese vehicles makes sense after seeing the BYD Sealion",
    "selftext": "Autogefuhl posted a review of it that I just noticed: [https://youtu.be/Vsejh-DtyxU?si=XN8lOWILcjAChkYh](https://youtu.be/Vsejh-DtyxU?si=XN8lOWILcjAChkYh)\n\n59K Euro's for the top trip and Tesla still costs a few thousand Euro's more. Then there's the build quality of the Sealion, which blows Tesla out of the water. Then there's the features...heads up display, rotating display, car play and android auto, working wipers, range etc.\n\nHere in Canada, the government is following the US, naturally, and is imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese EV's. Mind you, this is all happening while the very same peoples are shouting about the environment and climate change being \\*the\\* existential issue of our time.\n\nI don't know how to feel. I understand why NA/EU are afraid of Chinese EV's, and people having jobs that pay well and with dignity is also critical; but I really hate how we keep getting bombarded with exceptionally pricey EV's and even no tax breaks or very little, all while people are struggling to survive. WTF are people supposed to do but stick with gasoline vehicles then? It's not like public transport is any good or timely in winter especially.\n\nThis whole environmental/government angle has shot itself in the foot with how this has been handled. \n\nSealion top trim is roughly $44,000 CAD without tariffs, with tariffs it is $88,000 CAD. \n\nTesla Model Y is roughly $67,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.\n\nTesla Model 3 is roughly $63,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.\n\n\\^ This, is ridiculous and no amount of protecting our industries to give them time to play catch up, makes it reasonable for consumers.\n\nYes, there are used EV's on the market and I am considering one myself, but by the same token, used Chinese EV's would be even cheaper still and still offer more! It's not even about just the money, but what we're being offered for that money. The CEO's of major NA brands have gone on the record even stating that they'd rather go for more profit per vehicle sold and less volume(Hi Mary!) and that is just so frustrating. Because it kills EV adoption, makes the demand and urge to build more EV infrastructure not a priority, and slows or dare I say, could, kill or leave EV's in a weird place for a very long time.\n\nPeople often say, \"Bro, just buy a model 3, it's only like $30K after incentives\", as if incentives are the same everywhere, and that's still in USD, which is like $47k CAD. Our gross average household income in this country is like $53K. So even if you buy used and get a used model Y right now(Cheapest I can find is 35K at 153,000 KM), you will still be bombarded with GST+PST, giving you a final bill of at least 37K-40K depending where you are in Canada. For a used model Y at 153,000KM.\n\n**Tl;dr:** Car prices, and EV's especially are wack. Consumers are getting shafted due to admittedly understandable trade wars. I would gladly buy a BYD Sealion brand new at $44K and swallow that, over paying the same for a used high mileage Tesla Model Y or 3. At least I'd be getting a new vehicle for the blow to my wallet. If Juniper comes out and isn't $45K for LR out the door, then I'll stay on gas until such a time a new EV costs that much...or I get a really good deal on a used current gen Model Y.",

    "title": "I test drove a bunch more EVs, my thoughts on the winners and losers (Part 2)",
    "selftext": "[Given the unexpected popularity of my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1fygp10/test_drove_10_evs_at_a_local_event_my_thoughts_on/), and my hunt for EVs taking on more of a active role given a $2500 repair bill + the prospect of more in the summer for my wife's car, I've been taking more EVs out for a spin. I figured I'd share what I learned with the class, and hopefully someone else can benefit or just have fun reading about it\n\nTo answer some of the questions from the last post:\n\nIf a car isn't here, it's because I haven't driven it for whatever reason. As well, the EV landscape in Canada is pretty different from the EV landscape in the US. You guys seem to be getting incentive after incentive, and while it's *starting* to get better (no more \\~4 year waitlist for an Ioniq 5!) we're probably where you were at \\~1-2 years ago in terms of incentive. For example, the best lease deal I found on a non-stripper Ioniq 5 is around $1000 CAD/$720 USD. Likewise, while I'd love a $299 USD deal on an Equinox I see people posting about, best deal I got quoted from multiple dealers was \\~$600 CAD/$420 USD\n\nMost Surprising (Positive): Ford Mustang Mach-e\n\nMost Surprising (Negative): Audi Q4\n\nBest Value: Volkswagen ID.4 (among this crop, but overall is still the Tesla Model 3 LR RWD Highland)\n\nWorst Value: Tesla Model Y standard range\n\nVolkswagen ID.4: 5/10\n\nThis is the car version of vanilla ice cream. This is a car that uses energy to move wheels to get you places. This is a product you can purchase with money from selling your labour\n\nThere's nothing *wrong* with the ID.4. Both on paper and in real life, it is a competent driving object. It's just so fucking *bland*. There are certainly EVs who drive blandly, I've talked about them here. But usually they offer something to offset that; some sort of utility (the Lyriq/RZ and its comfort, the Equinox in its affordability), just... something.\n\nThis is the car version of the paper they wrap spring rolls in. Thin nothingness. Maybe that was fine when it was one of the few EVs you could actually go out and buy during the shortage, but now? It's competing in a segment (crossover SUV thing) and price point (roughly $50-65k CAD) that is INCREDIBLY crowded at the moment\n\nInfotainment is solidly okay, not awful like I've heard, but this 2024 is apparently the \"fixed\" version. Driving is boring, no feedback. The car feels like its off and just kinda gliding places, but not in a smooth luxury way. I don't know how to describe it other than it feels like what I thought a robotaxi would be, but you're actually driving the damn thing. Sterile.\n\nIf you are someone who always drives a Volkswagen, and you need a new car, this isn't something that will ruin your life. But is that what you want out of a car?\n\nAudi Q4: 4/10\n\nThis EV suffers from Blazer syndrome; if you're already spending the money, reach for a Q6. If you want the same package, just get the ID.4. Otherwise, I feel like you're spending a lot more money for what it ultimately the same product\n\nFor example, a top trim ID.4 and a base trim Q4 are about the same price ($63,231 and $63,400 CAD, respectively), and here's what you have to pay to gain feature parity:\n\n\\~$5000 to upgrade to the 55 quattro, to match the ID.4 Pro S' HP\n\n\\~$6000 premium package to match the ID.4's memory seats, among others\n\n\\~$5000 package to match the ID.4's adaptive cruise control\n\nThat's fucking nuts. Yes, the Q4 feels nicer inside. Yes, it handles better (marginally). Yes, if you pay even more, you can get certain features that the ID.4 doesn't have, like the VR Hud and the hands free cruise control, which are nice.\n\nAlso, the ID.4 has ventilated seats. You can't even option ventilated seats on the Q4! What's with the German OEMs and their hate for this feature?\n\nBut I feel like its nowhere near nice ENOUGH to justify spending that money on it. If you really want one, upgrade to the Q6, whose feature set and range and general build quality, from what I've read, seems to be a league better. And I know that \"just spend more money lol\" isn't necessarily fair, but option for option, if you're buying (or more likely, leasing) a new car that's in the \\~$75,000 range anyway, I really don't think that jumping to the \\~$85,000 range will trouble you, unless you can't really afford the $75k car anyway\n\nVolvo EX30: 6/10\n\nI'm not even mad; I'm just confused\n\nTo get this out of the way; I fucking LOVE this car. Once it hits the used market and we move to a place with enough driveway space for 2 EVs to overnight charge, this will be mine. I want it over the i4, and I fucking loved that car.\n\nIt's so fucking fun to drive. It feels very light on its feet, like you're zipping around. On the updated twin motors of \\~400+ horsepower (!) it feels like you're in a need for speed game (even when you're obeying the speed limit!). It reminds me most of a Golf GLI and then a Golf R, or maybe a Mini Cooper. This is the EV Golf that Volkswagen should be making; a fun but practical family car, and then an absurdly hot hatch in the form of the twin motor. And all that fun was before I turned traction control off!\n\nI'll also say that this is the smoothest implementation of regen braking I've had in a car. Absolutely peak, better than the previous winners of Tesla and BMW\n\nThe interior is very funky, in a way that activates my Spreadsheet brain. It's absolutely cost cutting, but honestly? It's still a nice place to be. At first I thought it'd feel way worse, because it had reverse Hyundai Effect (where their materials look nice but feel bad). The flecked plastic looked cheap, but when you're actually in it, it doesn't feel that bad.\n\nThe materials are certainly nowhere near as good as the S60 or XC60, but they still felt wayyy better than an average economy car. They look interesting, they feel interesting/pretty good. The seats remain incredible, even if not quite as good as their more expensive cousins\n\nLike I said, everything feels like it was designed with purpose. Most buttons pull double duty, the screen is how you do everything, but the infotainment is snappy, and designed in a very logical way. No Menu hell like the EQE\n\nBut that's the issue; it's a cost cutting vehicle... for fucking *$57,000 CAD!* ($41,000 USD). That's fucking absurd. This is supposed to be their entry level car, and it's more expensive than their gas XC40. It's more expensive than a base model XC60! Which is far larger and nicer. This car could do extremely well in Canada; I see Golfs and mazda 3s rolling around all the time. Priced a bit less (but still more) and Volvo could sell it well. But they're not, and why? This car goes against their move to being luxury, but in this case, why make it?\n\nAnd of course, I follow the Chinese market. This car is the less luxury version of its sister car, the Zeekr X! So don't give me any bullshit about \"oh we needed to cut costs : (\" [when the Zeekr X exists](https://www.datocms-assets.com/128969/1713875719-zeekrx_interior_main2_tab.jpg?auto=format), built in the same goddamn factory and sold for the same price in China (roughly $35,000 CAD).\n\nTo paraphrase a German: I say this full of admiration for the EX30. I love it, I love it very much. But I love it against my better judgement\n\nI am probably the demographic it was made from. I'm a young white collar professional who works in a boring industry, I compared these with spreadsheets, I consider Chinese design to be a positive instead of a negative for an EV, and I have awful fashion sense. If I'm hesitant about it, how well is it going to sell for a random 50 year old crosshopping it with an XC40?\n\nFord Mustang Mach-e: 8/10\n\nWINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER. This is the car my wife settled for.\n\nThere's a lot to like here; this car handles quite well for an SUV. It's no sports car, it's no Mustang. But you know, everyone knows the arguments now, so I won't get into it other than to say I will only call it a mach e\n\nInterior wise, the big ass tablet is kind of lame, but I feel like it's laid out in a logic fashion. It's response, it's fine, the wheel for volume makes a nice clicky sound when you use it, which pleases me. The turn signal noise sounds like horse hooves clicking. It satisfies my lizard brain. The materials aren't necessarily better than competition, but like the EX30, it's what you do with it that counts. They're laid out very nicely, everything feels and looks interesting, etc\n\nDriving feel is very American. Not necessarily super feedbacky, but you definitely don't feel this thing's weight around corners. I mean again, it's an SUV at the end of the day. But you can tell that Ford was REALLY trying here\n\nIt also is nice that it doesn't make eco mode feel like a penalty box. Really, Ford, Kia-Hyundai, Tesla, and Volvo are an odd coalition that makes you think that eco mode is how they expect you to drive it, and make that mode as nice and reasonable as possible\n\nSo why not a 10/10? If this is what we're buying, and we both love it, why an 8?\n\nWell, it's because we're buying one used. New? This car is simply not cost competitive. It is, for sure, a better car than the Equinox or Blazer from Chevrolet, or the Model Y from Tesla. It is simply not nearly $10,000 better\n\nYou can get any GM product for less, with more range. Oh, and they usually feel a bit bigger inside. Tesla is worse inside for the Y, but likewise you get native NACS, better range, and lower prices\n\nUsed, however? We're going to be picking up a 2021 Mach-e Premium extended range for $33,000 CAD sticker. That's more than 50% depreciation, for a vehicle with less than 30,000 kilometres on it. That's fucking NUTS, and good value\n\nThere are, theoretically, Mach-es that get in the same price, but the small battery is both short of range for not a big discount, and also unicorn tier rare. We can custom order one from the factory according to Ford, but one in the wild already made? Nah.\n\nChevrolet Silverado EV: 10/10\n\nThe letter to keep in mind for the Silverado EV is \"C\"\n\nThe first C is for Cavernous: its a full sized truck, but this is by far one of the most spacious vehicles I've been in, ever. Almost felt like more space than an Escalade. It's about the same size as an ICE Silverado, but holy shit. I genuinely felt like a kid who had climbed into his dad's truck. In the backseat, I felt like I was in a movie theatre\n\nThe second C is for Cheap. I sat in the work truck (base) model and actually drove the fully loaded one; night and fucking day. I swear there's a prototype WT trim out there with hand cranked windows. The smell of plastic was nausiated, and it was covered in what was genuinely one of the worst feeling fake leathers I've had the misfortunate of sitting in. Hard plastic galore\n\nSo yeah, this is a truck that's basically required to be purchased above base trim. Hell, if I was in the jury for a trial of a workman who beat his boss' ass for buying this for him, I would find him not guilty regardless of evidence\n\nBut otherwise... as someone who likes sedans, I felt dread driving this, because it was awesome. This is a Truck without *any* of the traditional downsides of owning a truck. Still body on frame, so it wasn't like it was perfect, but it felt far nicer than any truck I've driven before (besides the lightning). It felt peppy, and didn't feel like I was dragging a full sized truck around. It felt far more like an SUV than a truck\n\nLikewise, cost of fuel; napkin math says that I should be able to get \\~773 kilometres with the top trim gas engine (which, according to C&D, is actually more efficient than the 4 cyl, common 4 banger L). That needs premium fuel, so for the 90 litre tank at $1.85 a litre of 93, is \\~$166, or 22 cents a kilometre\n\nCompare that to the RST, with \\~708 kilometres of range from a battery that appears to be 205 kwh. At my overnight rate of $0.08 a kwh, I'd cost me $16.40 to charge, for a cost of 2.3 cents a kilometre\n\nBut there is a range, of course. Assuming you charge from zero to full at an average Tesla charger, you're going to pay $98.40 for a full \"tank\". Still cheaper, but less so\n\nBut then my province also offers a super low overnight rate of $0.023 kwh, knocking the Silverado down to being recharged for $5.74. For two coffees at tims, you can get 708 kilometres of range. Insane\n\nAll that being said, I expect trucks to SIGNIFICANTLY increase in popularity as time goes on\n\nLexus RZ: 7/10\n\nI'll probably get some flack for this, given that this and the Bzwhatever is the most hated car other than the cybertruck, but I thought that this was a pretty decent car\n\nIt feels like a Lexus, Electric. If you like Lexus, then you will like this car. Given the talk about it, I actually though the specs would be far worse. But the one I drove got an EPA range of \\~430 kilometres, with a max charging speed of 147 kws\n\nAnd you know what? That's *fine.* Would I buy this car? Not right now, because it'll be used on regular \\~550 kilometre roadtrips, but if I didn't? Very strong contender\n\nIt felt very nice inside, probably among the most comfortable after the various Volvos. Infotainment was solidly okay, nothing to write home about. It felt a bit slow on the highway, but like, who cares?\n\nThis is a car for people who are 50-80 years old, who have always bought Japanese, who want something nice in their golden years, who will go on a roadtrip of maybe 300 kilometres to get on a plane to get sunburnt at an all inclusive in Barbados. Essentially, this is a car made in a lab for My Father. So thank you Lexus!",

    "title": "Test Drove ~10 EVs at a local event, my thoughts on the winners and losers",
    "selftext": "Recently, my area had an event to promote electric driving, with a bunch of EVs being available for test drives. Naturally I decided to go and try out some. I'm a I suppose soft car enthusiast; I love cars, I love driving, but I don't need a manual diesel with cloth seats and roll down windows to enjoy myself. So these reviews will be from that perspective, and trying to view it from the target audience\n\nBecause this got so popular in r/electricvehicles, I decided to repost it here, with a few corrections/additions. Any brand you don't see here I either didn't drive at the event (VW ID.4) or wasn't there (Kia EV6, Rivian, etc). I also accidentally cut off a car while editting, so you guys get an extra review for no fee \n\nIf you want to fight in the comments about how my takes are trash quickly, here is a tdlr:\n\nMost Suprising (positive): Ford F150 Lightning\n\nMost Suprising (negative): Hyundai Ioniq 5\n\nBest Value: Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (Highland)\n\nWorst Value: Tesla Model Y Standard Range\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get started, in no particular order:\n\n1: Cadillac Lyriq: 7/10\n\nThis car feels like a classic Cadillac, for good and for ill. Everything about it is smooth, and it feels refined while putting its power down, not powerful but enough for what it is. Nothing particularly special in terms of charging or range, but I feel it fits the Cadillac clientel very well; lot's of room in the back and up front, touchscreen and cameras were good. UI was also very good, if a bit menu filled\n\nIt's downsides are, well, classically Cadillac. The interior was\u00a0*okay*. The sound system was\u00a0*okay*. But given the car's sticker said it was nearly\u00a0*$91,000 CAD before tax*\u00a0it shouldn't be\u00a0*okay*. It should be at the tier of the Germans, and it still just... isn't. I wouldn't be as offended if it was significantly less pricey than something like the new Q6 or EQE SUV, but it isn't. Especially after the Neue Klasse iX3 gets here, they'll need to cut prices imo\n\n2: Chevrolet Blazer: 4/10\n\nBuy an Equinox. Or buy a Lyriq if you have the cash. This car feels like a worse version of both at the same time, and I'm not sure why. Chevy for some reason seems to not quite have 1 pedal driving down as well as Cadillac does, and while I could forgive this for the Equinox to an extent, it somehow feels worse in the Blazer. Likewise, the interior is a major downgrade from the Lyriq but not\u00a0*really*\u00a0an upgrade over the Equinox. There's stiching on the doors, but it's all softish plastic, not even fake leather. Dash feels very similar, as do the buttons to the Equinox. I'd say it's like \\~10% nicer, and you get a HUD and a slightly larger vehicle than the Equinox. But if you want that, stretch for the Lyriq or get a slightly used one for the same price.\n\nMy first thought given the RS badge was that this would be the \"sporty\" one, but no. Zero steering feel, poor pedal feel, numb acceleration. I could forgive it, but given there's better options that GM makes, I think they just messed this one up\n\nOh, and normal door handles. The Blazer has that while the Equinox and Lyriq have the the pop out door handles. I have no idea why. It feels like they had a bunch of ICE Blazer door handles and want to use them up\n\n3: Ford F-150 Lightning: 8/10\n\nNow, to start; I am not a Truck guy. I don't have any use for one. No one in my family owns one. So keep that in mind for this review\n\nBut I gotta say, I was really blown away by the F-150 Lightning. It's a huge truck, but it really doesn't FEEL that way. The steering is good, manuverability is great, far better than you'd think for such a beast. Honestly, other than the massive tires reminding me, it felt like I was driving a midsized SUV, not a full sized truck\n\nIf you don't tow far or often, and you want a full sized, Ford is offering a whole bunch of cash on the hood. And it feels like a normal Ford! Physical gear shifter, same sort of seating, same UI. A bit meh UI, but it's very user friendly. I was genuinely shocked at how much I enjoyed it\n\nIt solves the two major issues imo of a full sized ICE truck; fuel economy and driving feel. If you can get a deal and want a truck; jump on it. Just be aware that this is very much a gen 1 product and won't hold value\n\n4: Hyundai Ioniq 5: 8.5/10\n\nYou know that saying that a heretic is worse than a heathen? That's my experience with the Ioniq 5. It's\u00a0*so close*\u00a0to being a 10/10, but there's a few ergonomic issues that just really kill it\n\nIt has great one pedal driving, imo tied for 2nd with Tesla, slightly behind Volvo. Great charging speed, suprisingly fun handling given its an SUV. Read the reviews; it's great, everyone says it is, and I agree with them\n\n*However*; 3 major issues that I found. First; the steering wheel obscures the gauge cluster unless you put it up unnaturally high. Second, the seat. I couldn't really find a comfy seating position; even with the seat all the way down, I felt like my head was almost touching the roof, and I'm not even that tall at \\~6'1. Third, the bezels around the infotainment are absurdly large. It feels like an old timey TV with the massive box around them\n\nNow, most of this is apparently fixed in the 2025 model year refresh. But it's just frustrating becasue even with the Ioniq 6 which I saw there, the bezel issue wasn't as bad. They know it's bad clearly! But it took awhile to fix. If you don't mind these things, then this is imo the best value. But I can't get over it\n\n5: Tesla Model Y SR: 6/10\n\nThis is another similar casualty to the Blazer and the Ioniq 5. It's not AWFUL; although I find the interior to be pretty bad for the price. But the Model 3 highland fixes all the issues I have with the current Model Y, and it does it while being cheaper. I'd really,\u00a0*strongly*\u00a0recommend waiting until whatever the Model Y update\n\nDrivetrain wise, pretty good! Tesla has good one pedal driving, like I said previously. It just falls apart with the interior quality. I found that the fake wood (or maybe real?) just felt really bad to the touch. I had a hard time adjusting the air vents in a pleasing way, which was annoying. The seats were just very uncomfortable, the merged headrest felt awful after awhile. Maybe if it was an economy car, whatever. But given the only configuration available for purchase new is the LR at \\~$60,000 CAD, I expect better\n\nOtherwise, I think it's... okay. For the price it was useable when the only competition it really has was the ID.4 and nearly impossible to get models like the Ioniq 5. But now supply has caught up, new models exist, and like I said; I\u00a0*know*\u00a0that Tesla can do better because they do! They have a great product in the form of the Model 3 Highland!\n\n6: Chevrolet Equinox: 9/10\n\nChevy has a hit in the making if they can just market it well. This car will be my next vehicle.\n\nNow that my cards are on the table, I will offer some criticism. The UI works fine, concerns there are overblown. But it's just a bit slow. Not the WORST (looking at you Volvo) by any means, but something that's disappointing. 1PD isn't super smooth, but it's less bad than the Blazer\n\nOtherwise, I'll just say that this car provides value. Good range, okay charging speeds, but good enough. This is the car of close enough; everything except range isn't really class leading, but for the price and all together makes a great package\n\nMy biggest complaint? I'd like to denounce the Chevy exec who gave this thing 21 inch rims. It looks ridiculous, like a child wearing their father's shoes. But hey, maybe there were people who said \"yes, I'd love worse ride quality and worse fuel economy\". Maybe there are! If so, I'll apologize; you're a victim too\n\nI honestly want to try and hypermile this. I genuinely think if I knocked this thing down to 19 or 18', I could hit the high 550s\n\n7: Tesla Model 3 SR (Highland): 9/10\n\nTesla is the Apple of cars; you love it or you don't, but you have some sort of feeling about it one way or another. But if you're a spiritual Android user, if you can swallow your dislike, there's a LOT to like here\n\nEvery material issue I have with the model Y is basically solved. Better materials, better comfort, it feels quieter. Already very great UI is somehow even faster and better. For under $50k CAD, the RWD Standard range provides a whole bunch of value. \\~440 km of range, good charging, access to the Tesla network (obviously), ventilated seats... again, 90% of my issue with it comes down to the monoscreen. I Just Don't Like It. It's not an issue for driving, but I don't find it aesthetically pleasing\n\nBut like I said; tonnes of value here if you like it or don't care about the layout.\n\n8: BMW i4 M50: 10/10\n\nYou ever hear the phrase \"Jack of all trades, master of none. But better the Jack, than a master of one\"? That is the BMW i4 to a tee. Nothing really crazy; even in terms of HP, there's faster cars out there. But my god does it come together in a fundamentally great package. The owner of this car was an enthusiasts, so he encouraged me to really give this the gas (or whatever) and it was great. He took over for awhile and REALLY gave it, and imo you could feel the weight around 9/10ths - but frankly, I don't think I'd ever get it there with any regularity, so the remaining 8/10ths are great\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't recommend it is that it's pricey. My man had literally every possible option, down to the full leather seats, and the special paint. He said it was near 100k all in all. Now he also mentioned offhandedly that his wife sat in and loved the new iX and so they bought it when he went to pick his new i4 up a few years back, so I assume he's good for money, but still. Damn pricey\n\nAfter a few years of BMW depreciation though? Madon, fantastic used vehicle\n\n9: Nissan Ariya: 6/10\n\nWho is this for?\n\nIn theory, the Ariya isn't a bad vehicle. It's rather nice actually; comfortable interior, very smooth powertrain, nice touchpoints. Very roomy! It feels like a much larger vehicle than it is\n\nMy issue with it was that its top trim is nearly $*65,000 CAD*. And it used to be more! They simplified the 25 trim differences, and that used to hit the 70s! The small battery option is in the mid 50s, and then it gets progressively more expensive. What justifies that? No super fast charging like the Ioniq 5, no major range, not really any brand appeal. Nissan seemed to make a Murano equivalent, but I never see Muranos! I see Rogues! They needed a Leaf varient with Rogue styling, and didn't deliver. I saw one for sale today with an advertised $10,000 cash on the hood. That says everything, imo\n\nIf it topped out at, say, 60, then I think that'd be fair enough. But even then, I find the local Nissan dealership awful to talk with based on my sister's experience with them, but that's not necessarily Nissan's fault\n\n10: Volvo EX40: 7.5/10\n\nYou know the gene some people have that makes Cilantro taste like soap? That's Volvo. You either have the gene that makes you love Volvo, or you don't. I happen to have it, but I'll try and be objective\n\nThe powertrain; fantastic. It's smooth, but not in the same way as Hyundai or Tesla with their 1 pedal driving. You feel everything, but it feels fantastic. Steering is tight while driving fast, while instantly becoming very light and manuverable at low speeds. Great sound system even in the \"cheap\" harmen kardon option versus the B&O, and incredibly comfortable seats, as Volvo often does well\n\nThe downside is that this is a 40 series, not a 60 series, and it feels like it. Not super plush in terms of touchpoints, the seats are a textile blend. But it still feels nice enough. It's also very clearly a first gen product; it's just an electric XC40. Infotainment system also needs some work; it's slow, menu hell, and just generally a pain\n\nBut like I said; it's just so\u00a0*nice*\u00a0that I can ignore any flaws. Buy it used or lease it, and wait for the new EX60 to come out\n\n11: Polestar 2 (2024): 8/10\n\nIf any car would win the \"most improved in a single 3 year cycle\", it's the Polestar 2. I drove a 2022 when it first came out, and while it was good, I was just baffled by a few decisions. Lots of gloss black plastic, no options for leather (or fake leather!) seats, and FWD? On a 4 series competitior?\n\nBut my god have they turned it around. RWD, Nappa leather with ventilated seats, and next year they're even getting rid of the gloss black in the cabin. I've really never seen a company respond so quickly to criticism. My only remaining issue in terms of design is that I liked the old grilles better than the new ones, but you can't get everything, can you?\n\nGreat steering, great steering feel, great handling around corners... but there is a huge But here. The style it's trying to ape is like a cockpit; it is almost shockingly cramped in the front of the car. There is a HUGE transmission tunnel, and it's styled almost like it's trying to look even bigger than it actually is. Screen with no buttons for UI is not great, but acceptable, but to then cheap out on a SOC and have it be *laggy* is unacceptable, especially at the price point\n\nI say this not because I don't like the Polestar 2, I like it a lot. But because this is clearly a round one product for Polestar, and I genuinely am concerned about their future. They are specifically trying to be a Porsche competitor; and I think the 2 is good, but they simply are not. If they built the Polestar 2 on a next gen platform to take the fight to BMW/Audi/Mercedes, I think they would be much more successful. But having the Polestar 3 be a Cayenne competitor? No. They need to target the X3/Q5/GLC market. And they're just not at this point \n\n",

It's crazy the vehicles you see. \n\nAnd living in Tiburon, you could probably sit for 10 minutes and watch a Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, historic Dachshund, 1960 Maserati, Aston Martin from the '70s and the 2000s, it's surreal.

I think a short vacation just focused on cars without thinking I'm going to bid at an auction would be a really fun use of time.",

    "title": "My extensive 6-month Taycan GTS ownership review",
    "selftext": "I used to own a Tesla Model 3 Performance as a daily driver and C8 Z51 as a weekend car. While both cars were great, the build quality of the Model 3 Performance as well as its \u201cappliance like\u201d personality started to zip a lot of joy from my day to day driving experience (as easy as it was). Likewise, while I loved the Corvette it wasn\u2019t quite scratching the performance \u201citch\u201d the way I really wanted it to, and as a weekend driver it felt like a lot of money to put into something that I was only experiencing on the weekends. I eventually had to return the Corvette to GM due to a warranty issue and used it as an opportunity to get myself into a Porsche Taycan GTS. \n\nFor the Porsche folks the car is optioned with the following: \n-Premium Package\n-Thermally noise and insulated glass \n-Adaptive Cruise Control \n-Leather interior \n-Rear Wheel Steer \n-Porsche Dynamic Chasis Control \n-Porsche Torque Vectoring \n-Sports Chrono\n\nThe car is in a pretty nice GTS color spec which you can check out here: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/mgVuRmI\n\nI\u2019d also like to mention that I have driven quite a few different obtainable cars. This list is the following: C5 Corvette, V6 5th Gen Camaro, C7 Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, C8 Corvette Z06, Tesla Model 3 AWD, Pre-Highland Tesla Model 3 Performance, Porsche Taycan Turbo & Taycan 4S, 997.2 Porsche 911 Turbo, 718 Porsche Cayman Base, Alfa Romeo 4C, Alfa Romeo Giulia QV, Ford Focus RS, 2008 Audi R8 V8, Audi TTRS, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400 and the Lotus Elise. \n\nI\u2019ll mainly be comparing the car to my experience owning a Model 3 Performance and C8. \n\n**Handling:** \n\nWhen I first drove a Taycan a few years ago I was absolutely blown away by the car\u2019s handling. To me it legitimately felt sports car like, while offering an incredibly comfortable ride.\n\nAfter living with the car for a few months I still have the same general opinion, but there\u2019s a few nuances that I\u2019ve picked up on. \n\nWith the rear wheel steer, Air Suspension, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (active sway bars), and Porsche Torque Vectoring (limited slip differential), there\u2019s a lot of suspension magic allowing the car to show flashes of brilliance whenever you take a corner. The rear wheel steer helps give the car the impression of an incredibly sharp and precise turn in. The PDCC system keeps the car sports-car flat in long corners. You can feel the Torque Vectoring/Limited Slip Differential system help tuck the car in when flying into a particularly \u201cinteresting\u201d corner. Lastly the air suspension gives you a fantastic range of \u201cfloating barely feel an imperfection on the road\u201d dampening in normal mode up to \u201ctight, controlled, but always composed\u201d dampening in sports plus. \n\nI mention all of these elements because it is pretty cool seeing the car utilize all of this magic, and it allows the car to showcase a really broad range of handling characteristics. If you happen to like a certain element of your given sports car\u2019s handling, it\u2019s likely the Taycan can showcase that characteristic. Likewise there\u2019s a lot of times that these suspension tools allow you to pull off stupid maneuvers that you\u2019d think twice doing in anything that\u2019s basically not a McLaren. \n\nNow for how impressive the Taycan\u2019s handling is you do notice the car\u2019s weight and size, but these things reveal themselves almost selectively and you kind of learn how to drive around them. For instance when on a twisty road you find yourself almost immediately coming onto the brakes. This is partially because you can accelerate pretty darn rapidly coming out of a corner, and you may find yourself hitting 80mph when on another car you may only get up 60mph in the same distance. But this is also because the car weighs so much that you have a sense that braking is just going to be a little bit more of a process so you won\u2019t be able to completely bail yourself out of trouble if you find yourself in a late braking event. While the car does a great job of shrinking around you once you\u2019re driving it, you get the sense that changing direction isn\u2019t quite as immediate as it would be in another car and that the steering effort maybe requires a bit more muscle than it would compared to something lighter. Likewise you get the general sensation of G-forces much quicker in this car due to its weight. \n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is though you feel this car\u2019s weight, it is managed so well that you don\u2019t necessarily mind it. For instance all of the Taycan\u2019s suspension magic has allowed me to throw the car into turns way harder and with way more confidence and enjoyment than I\u2019ve been able to in my C8 Z51. This isn\u2019t to say that the Taycan\u2019s handling is better than a C8\u2019s per say, it\u2019s just there\u2019s a level of safety and ease of access available in the Taycan\u2019s handling that I haven\u2019t experienced on another car thus far. On the streets being able to do impressive maneuvers with consistency and a sense of safety, is much more important than a car that has high limits but could bite you as you approach those limits. Likewise when my Model 3 would lose regen (due to high battery charge) the car would feel very pig-like. Much harder to control, much harder to manage speed, you could tell the Model 3 really relied on regen to stay light on its feet. With the Taycan, whether you have regen on or not, the car\u2019s driving dynamics feel very similar. \n\nI\u2019ve found the Taycan\u2019s brakes to work generally well.  In canyon driving you feel like you have plenty of stopping power (though as mentioned you do want to be on the brakes sooner rather than later due to weight). Around town the brakes are consistent and easy to modulate. The Taycan features a blended regen braking system where using the brakes starts with a high amount of regen back into the system, and friction brakes are added in if additional stopping power is necessary, or at the tail end of a deceleration to bring the car to a complete stop. The advantage with this system is you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re penalized for using the brake pedal, as in a Tesla whenever you touch the brake pedal you are using friction brakes. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve ran into with the Taycan\u2019s blended braking is there are some odd points when coming to a complete stop where you can feel the regen brakes \u201clet go\u201d and the friction brakes take over. When this happens you can feel the car almost want to lurch forward a little but as this transition point becomes an odd \u201cpause\u201d in the deceleration curve. Regen has the car progressively slowing down, regen \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d the car does not slow down at this \u201clet go\u201d point, friction brakes take over, car comes to a complete stop. Now this only happens at certain speeds and braking distances, so it\u2019s not anywhere near as consistent as the weird brake by wire funky-ness I felt in a Giulua QV, but I do think it\u2019s an area of improvement for Porsche. \n\nSurprisingly, I\u2019ve been a big fan of the car\u2019s steering feel. Now I personally get super annoyed when I see car reviewers talk about steering feel. They\u2019ll always review some awesome car that looks to be a lot of fun and they\u2019ll go \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t have any steering feel and that\u2019s SO important\u201d and then they\u2019ll give the nod to some other car that\u2019s more expensive, looks crappier, and is ultimately slower, but because it has a better steering feel and driver inputs it\u2019s definitely the better car. I always feel like it\u2019s the equivalent of sleeping with some 10/10 girl and then complaining after the fact that she wasn\u2019t a blonde and that the 7/10 girl was better because she was blonde. I don\u2019t know, as someone who has owned an Elise, spent plenty of time in Evoras and a variety of other sports cars, I\u2019ve just never found steering feel to make up for a car\u2019s deficiencies in other areas. \n\nAnyways, the Taycan\u2019s steering feel makes the car very delightful to drive. There\u2019s plenty of off-centered responsiveness through the chassis and wheels.  As you turn the wheel you feel car responding and reacting to you. I don\u2019t want to say you gets tons of feedback through the wheel per say, but something about the steering makes you feel connected to the road, comfortable, and sporty all at the same time. Is the steering feel a reason to buy a Taycan? I wouldn\u2019t say so, but it\u2019s something that reveals itself to you the more and more you drive the car and it really does delight you. \n\nA big item I noticed is the Taycan\u2019s handling continues to feel sharp and responsive well past 120mph. On the Model 3 Performance you\u2019d start to feel the car get a bit uncomfortable with its handling and braking past about 85mph or so. This gives highway driving a rather nice dimension in the Taycan as you basically experience the car\u2019s handling prowess no matter what speed you\u2019re going. \n\nAll in all I\u2019d say the Taycan is one of the most enjoyable handling cars on the street you can get today. There\u2019s definitely ICE vehicles out there with less weight and higher limits, but what I\u2019ve always found is those ICE vehicles can have a very narrow \u201cfun\u201d window that\u2019s also safe to experience and demonstrate on the streets. With the Taycan you can kind of just throw it into corners and let the suspension magic amaze you. Yes I know some of you are going to talk about how it\u2019s important to feel the lightweight analog \u201cdance\u201d with something like a Miata or a car with lower limits, but I gauge handling as having complete confidence in the car no matter the maneuver or situation, and in this regard the Taycan continues to impress me each day. \n\n**Power:** \n\nThe power on the Taycan is an interesting experience. \n\nThe car very much likes you to \u201croll\u201d onto the accelerator. Even if you stab the throttle in sports plus mode it feels like the car almost hesitates or eases into its acceleration before really picking up speed a few moments later. I\u2019d contrast this with my Model 3 Performance, which has a super sharp initial throttle response and wants to just blast you from 0-80mph with an immense wave of torque if you put your foot all the way down. \n\nInterestingly even though the Taycan feels a little sluggish off the line the car continues to pull quite hard well north of 100mph. Pedal travel feels a little long, but what I\u2019ve particularly noticed is as you depress the pedal the car continues to offer more acceleration. For instance in my Model 3 I could be going 80mph, do a 50% blip on the accelerator and really not feel too much additional acceleration due to being towards the top of the car\u2019s torque curve. In the Taycan I could be at 80mph, do a 50% accelerator blip, feel a noticeable increase in acceleration, and then increase to a 80% accelerator blip and feel even more speed start to gain. \n\nSo basically the Taycan doesn\u2019t exactly throw all of its power at you from lower speeds like you\u2019d expect from most EV\u2019s nowadays, but it gives you plenty of additional power and acceleration as you continue to use the accelerator pedal. This strategy has some interesting side effects. You don\u2019t exactly feel like you can just blatantly out-drag  someone like you\u2019d be able to in a Tesla, but because the pedal travel is so long and the car continues to build speed, your accelerations feel much more satisfying to experience. For instance, holding down the accelerator for 10 seconds in the Taycan feels much more rewarding than holding down the accelerator for 10 seconds in a Model 3 Performance, even though the Model 3 performance may deliver more G\u2019s and initial speed on acceleration. Likewise, because the Taycan likes to continue to build speed I\u2019ve found myself hitting triple digits a lot in the car\u2026like a lot a lot. So it\u2019s an odd sensation, where you don\u2019t necessarily get all of the crazy 0-60 acceleration and G\u2019s as you would other EV\u2019s, but you find yourself ultimately having more rewarding accelerations and going much faster at the end of the day. \n\nThe Taycan has a 2-speed transmission which accounts for a lot of the car\u2019s top-end. I\u2019ve found the 2-speed transmission to be awesome when it works, but a little disappointing in other scenarios. It feels like 1st gear ends somewhere in the 60mph range and 2nd gear starts just slightly north of 60mph. When in Sports mode or Sports Plus the car will start in 1st until around 60mph and in Normal Mode the car starts in 2nd gear and pretty much stays in 2nd the whole time. When in 1st gear you do get a very \u201cTesla-like\u201d amount of acceleration off the line. It\u2019s a meaty and rapid wave of torque in 1st and then when you get into 2nd gear you get tons of additional top end build. However if you hit the accelerator at say 40mph the car knows it\u2019s going to run out of 1st gear soon so it subtly cuts the power until you get into 2nd gear and the car starts to pull hard afterwards. So oddly enough it\u2019s possible to get some very inconsistent torque and acceleration levels depending on your speed. A pull at 30mph may feel way harder than a pull at 40mph simply because the car is limiting torque at 40mph in anticipation of shifting into 2nd. I\u2019d contrast this with most other EV\u2019s where a pull at \u201cX\u201d mph is always going to feel the same no matter what. I\u2019ve personally found this to be a little frustrating as I\u2019ve had times where the car has just blown me away with its acceleration when I\u2019ve gotten the speed and gearing correct, then I\u2019ve had times where the car just hasn\u2019t really taken off because I\u2019ve been in \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d from a gearing perspective. It\u2019s kind of an odd thing to have to deal with in an EV. \n\nThe 2-speed transmission aside, I\u2019ve also felt like the car\u2019s traction control is a little less dialed in than it could be. In the Model 3 you felt like the car was always willing to give you the most amount of torque and power it possibly could given the driving conditions. In the Taycan I sometimes feel like the car is pulling power in situations where the Model 3 wouldn\u2019t be pulling power. I find this interesting considering the Taycan\u2019s suspension generally makes it feel more composed across the board compared to the Model 3. To me this could be a side of effect of Tesla\u2019s hardware being better integrated than Porsche\u2019s. \n\nIn launch control I\u2019ve found that the Taycan GTS feels ever so slightly less powerful than my old Model 3 performance off the line, but as mentioned the acceleration feels much more rewarding and gratifying to stay buried in compared to the Model 3. Likewise though my C8 Corvette had higher objective acceleration numbers, the Taycan feels much faster on canyon roads because it\u2019s able to deliver gobs of torque more consistently than the C8. \n\nOne interesting observation I\u2019ve noticed is my Taycan\u2019s speedometer appears to read about 3mph faster than other external measurements. For instance I drive past a speed limit warning board pretty consistently on my commute and my Taycan will say I\u2019m going 50mph and the warning board will say I\u2019m going 47mph. I don\u2019t particularly care about this either way, but I found it to be an interesting observation. I haven\u2019t verified or cross referencing this with GPS measurements like a draggy, but I\u2019ve noticed this pretty consistently. \n\nAll in all I\u2019d say the Taycan GTS is kind of an odd car where it can feel slower than its numbers indicate at times, but it can also get to speeds much higher and faster than you\u2019d get in other cars. I definitely don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing speed compared to my Model 3 Performance, which is objectively a bit of a stronger puller off the line, but I do wish the Taycan\u2019s power delivery was a bit more consistent in terms of managing traction control and in managing power for shifting.\n\n**Styling:** \n\nI personally really enjoy the styling on the Taycan. It\u2019s one of the few cars that looks properly close to its original concept, and I find it to have a great blend of sportiness, elegance, and technological forwardness. The Taycan is also one of the only 4-door cars that I can think of that feels properly \u201csports car-like\u201d in sedan form. Every other 4-door car that I generally know of is \u201csedan that has stuff on it to look sporty\u201d I think Porsche did a great job leveraging some of the EV styling opportunities available to them to really take this car\u2019s design to a high level.   I don\u2019t find the Taycan to be the 10/10 knockout that my Chrome Orange Elise was, but it has a really nice presence to it and I always appreciate looking at it every time I walk up to the car. \n\nWhat I particularly enjoy about the Taycan\u2019s styling is it has a really nice way of \u201cfitting in\u201d everywhere it goes. If I take the car to a hot valet spot, it\u2019s often parked out front. If I\u2019m in a bad part of town, it somehow doesn\u2019t draw a ton of negative attention. When I\u2019m wanting to mix it up with other flashy cars, it more than holds its own in terms of looks. Because of this \u201cfit in wherever you go\u201d style I\u2019ve found that I have a much easier time driving the car spiritedly whenever I want to. In my old C8 I would truly notice people treating me worse in traffic, and when I did drive my C8 spiritedly I always felt like it drew almost too much attention. So there\u2019s a real \u201caccessibility\u201d to the Taycan\u2019s styling that I haven\u2019t quite experienced in other vehicles before. You\u2019re not too boy racer, you\u2019re not too soft or elegant, you\u2019re not too flashy, and you\u2019re not too subdued. I feel like the Taycan makes it hard to give people a negative read on you. \n\n**Build Quality:**\n\nBuild quality was a pretty big reason for buying this car. My Model 3 Performance inexplicably turned itself into a wind noise induced rattle can after about 18 months of ownership so I really wanted to avoid that experience again. On EV\u2019s it\u2019s just so easy to hear every little cabin imperfection so I wanted to see what Porsche\u2019s renown build quality brought to the table. \n\nYou definitely get the impression that the Taycan is built to last long. Everything in the car feels solid, the doors feel weighty, and close with a very confidence inspiring \u201cthump\u201d. So far I\u2019ve avoided any major technological or drivability related issues in the car. I generally get the impression that the car is going to feel as \u201csolid\u201d at mile 100,000 as it does at mile 10,000. I have also driven the vehicle quite hard in my time owning it and it has generally felt \u201cover engineered\u201d as if I\u2019m not really stressing it at all. \n\nThat being said my car has a pretty noticeable dash rattle that is caused from the plastic HUD cover heating up and expanding when parked outside. Likewise my driver\u2019s side door panel has a slight rattle, almost as if something is loose inside of it. The car has been to the dealer twice to resolve the issues and thus far they haven\u2019t been successful.  To be honest my Porsche dealer service level hasn\u2019t been stellar by any means and I\u2019m kind of annoyed that this is something I\u2019m having to navigate on a car with a relatively high MSRP. Porsche also pretty much makes one interior that they put in all of their vehicles, so it\u2019s not like the car has some really avante garde design-work going on which is causing fitment challenges, etc. \n\nIn talking to other Taycan members it seems like each one has its own issue. Some have charging issues, others have technology/infotainment issues, I happen to have rattle issues. A lot of people hype up Porsche for the pristine build quality, attention to detail and high level dealership experience and I haven\u2019t quite felt that at all for how much this car costs. \n\nSo in summary the Taycan lives in this odd build quality space where you can tell it was built to last and that they really over engineered some parts of the car, but a lot of Taycans tend to have quirks or issues that shouldn\u2019t be occurring in vehicles that start at $100K and go up to $250K. \n\nIronically the best EV I\u2019ve driven to date from a build quality perspective has been my wife\u2019s Bolt EUV. No rattles, very good NVH isolation for the price point, and technology that\u2019s dead-on reliable. I really think GM, Ford, and Stellantis can make a run on EV\u2019s if they play their cars right. Lucid, Tesla, and Rivian still are having QC teething issues, the Germans are caught with their pants down this gen, and the Japanese are sitting EVs out. If the big three in America can get some normal looking EVs on the road with normal functioning tech and non-BS build quality I really think they can really carve a space for themselves. \n\n**Practicality:** \n\nWhen I tested the Taycan against my Model 3 Performance I was pretty worried about practicality. The Taycan is physically bigger but has smaller trunk spaces and a tighter feeling cabin with less storage. \n\nIn owning the Taycan I really haven\u2019t missed the extra space I lost in the Model 3 Performance. However in my day to day living, there are (4) compromises I\u2019ve noticed.\n\n* -The Model 3 has a much larger sub trunk cavity which can carry a duffle bag. The Taycan\u2019s sub trunk cavity is much smaller so I lost out on an \u201cemergency\u201d duffle bag that I used to keep with me. \n\n* -There\u2019s no good space to store sunglasses in the Taycan. The center console storage is too shallow so I have my sunglasses in an empty space behind the climate control screen. The catch is that particularly space is not really designed for storage, but it gets the job done. \n\n* -The shape of the trunk just makes it every so slightly hard for people to squeeze luggage into it. So that\u2019s made for some interesting airport pickups. Honestly if it was a couple of inches taller or more squared off it would make a huge difference for the usability. \n\n* -There\u2019s no storage pockets behind the front seats for some reason. Which I wouldn\u2019t mind if the car had some badass exposed carbon seats, but it doesn\u2019t. So this felt like an odd omission to me. \n\nI was also supremely worried about reverting to older tech and infotainment since Tesla\u2019s is pretty much the best there is right now and the Taycan\u2019s was basically a generation behind when it launched in 2020, and is essentially 2 gens behind right now. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve found is while the Taycan definitely misses out on a lot of UI snazziness and ease of use, it makes up for it by having a lot of things that my Model 3 just simply didn\u2019t have. \n\n* -The Taycan\u2019s backup camera is low res, fish eyed, and kind of sucks. Likewise its parking sensors beep in a way that makes it very hard to gauge your actual proximity near objects. But the fact that the Taycan has a surround view camera generally makes most parking situations a lot more straightforward than Tesla\u2019s system. While I still think the fisheye camera is a huge oversight, it does a great job at helping you see cross traffic, so I almost use it to see where traffic is coming from and then I use my mirrors to do the rest. \n\n* -The Taycan has normal turn signal stalks that behave normally (was never a fan of Tesla\u2019s turn signal stalks even when they had them) and you can shift the car into drive with a normal gear selector. \n\n* -All of your climate controls are available without having to dig into a sub menu. \n\n* -There\u2019s normal blind spot monitors. \n\n* -Taycan\u2019s adaptive cruise control just works and doesn\u2019t have phantom braking like Tesla\u2019s autopilot or adaptive cruise control. \n\n* -You can open your frunk by touch as opposed to having to use your phone. \n\nIn short there\u2019s just a lot more \u201cnormal\u201d car stuff in the Taycan that balances out all of the tech stuff that you lose in the Tesla. Te more I\u2019ve driven my Taycan the more I\u2019ve realized that a lot of Tesla\u2019s stuff doesn\u2019t really make for an easier or better driving experience. It\u2019s kind of there to help mask a lack of hardware features that probably should be standard in a Tesla. The Tesla is like going to a restaurant with a great atmosphere and so-so food. Whereas the Taycan is the restaurant with great food but a stuffy environment. Sometimes the fun atmosphere is a reason to go to a restaurant, but a lot of times you\u2019re there to eat first. \n\nI\u2019ve found the rear wheel steering my Taycan to be pretty awesome. You can essentially full U-turn in a two lane road without needing to do a 3-point turn. It also gives you a lot of flexibility with your angle of approach in parking lots. The only drawback is it does take some getting used to at slower speeds, and I do find myself doing weird crooked parking jobs inexplicably, but you get used to it and get better at it. \n\nThe car has a \u201csmart lift\u201d functionality, which is great because the car can get pretty low and it does have big overhangs. What I\u2019ve found is it does take a while to raise the vehicle and it only activates at 20MPH or less. This makes it a little hard to pull into a steep driveway coming off of a 40mph road since you basically can\u2019t get yourself down to 20mph and give the system enough time to raise up before having to enter the driveway. Still it does provide some added comfort when working with steep angles that you come across at lower speeds. \n\nWhile I do like the Taycan\u2019s blind spot sensors I have found them to be a little too conservative. There\u2019s times where they stay on because a car \u201ccould\u201d be entering my blind spot, not because it\u2019s actually in my blind spot. So this has made it a little hard to be as aggressive as I sometimes want to be in traffic \n\nAll in all I\u2019ve found the Taycan to be plenty practical for my day to day use and not nearly as much of a compromise from the \u201cTesla experience\u201d as I thought it would be. \n\n**Tech/EV Stuff:** \n\nI have some pretty good write-ups comparing the Taycan to Model 3 Performance and I also have a writeup talking about my recent Taycan roadtrip both of which can be found in my post history. I don\u2019t want to belabor every little EV and tech nuance here. However here are my general impressions after owning the vehicle. \n\n* -The car\u2019s range indicator feels very accurate and reliable. Yes the car only has a 220 mile EPA range, but that\u2019s 220 real world miles versus say 300 Tesla miles that somehow become 220 miles of range very quickly. \n\n* -The Taycan likes to dump battery pretty aggressively when driven hard but it is also easier to drive more efficiently than my old Tesla. The Tesla wouldn\u2019t dump battery as aggressively when driven hard, but never felt quite as comfortable driving efficiently on the highway as the Taycan. \n\n* -Non Tesla fast charging completely sucks. There\u2019s not enough charging stalls in the non-Tesla networks and too many EV owners use their free EA charging as their primary means of charging as opposed to a \u201croad trip only\u201d use case scenario.\n\n* -I feel like the lack of one-pedal drive from Porsche (and continued insistence on not including it on the Macan EV and I assume the Cayman EV) to be complete silliness. This car would be much more comfortable and easier to drive with its inclusion. That being said, you do get used to Porsche\u2019s lighter regen modes, and blended regen braking so the lack of one pedal drive isn\u2019t completely as dire as I though it was. \n\nI know Porsche has a lot of talk about wanting to control the car dynamically as a reason for not including one pedal driving. I honestly think they should just make a mode called \u201ccomfort\u201d that gives one pedal driving and softens everything up completely. Then \u201cNormal\u201d \u201cSport\u201d and \u201cSports Plus\u201d can all be modes that can\u2019t have one pedal driving for that curated Porsche driving experience. My wife\u2019s bolt EUV has a steering wheel paddle for added regen when coming to a spot. That could also be a really good solution for introducing a controlled one pedal driving experience to Porsche drivers. \n\n* -The car has an \u201cintelligent\u201d recuperation mode where it will apply regen for you so that you always stay a certain distance behind a car. Unfortunately this mode never seems to lock onto the car in front of you appropriately and it seems to stop working the second the car in front of you starts to come to a complete stop. If this mode worked through a stop it would be a great solution for not having one pedal driving. Right now it\u2019s so inconsistent that I only turn it on for slow twisty road traffic that I don\u2019t expect to stop any time soon. \n\n\n* -For whatever reason the Taycan does not automatically lock when you walk away from the vehicle. You can lock it with pressure sensors on the door handles or with your key fob. I find this exclusion to be pretty baffling in this day and age. I\u2019ve trained myself pretty well to lock the car manually again, but I wish the phone app would alert you if your car has been unlocked for a certain period of time. I do kind of miss the Tesla \u201cget in and go\u201d \u201cget out and forget it\u201d mentality that you can have on busy days. \n\n* -For some reason my car seems to lose its ambient light setting every 7-days or so. Feels like a very odd software thing to have issues with. \n\n* -I\u2019ve had instances where the PCM has booted up into \u201c911 mode\u201d where it has briefly displayed things like \u201cauto-blip\u201d and other ICE only options in the \u201cvehicle\u201d page. How ICE PCM software is even on my car feels like complete silliness to me. \n\n* -The phone app isn\u2019t too far of a drop off from Tesla\u2019s. It\u2019s a little more clunky but I find a lot of the functionality to still be present. However the app likes to report that windows are rolled down when they are not. Likewise I wish the app had the ability to give you some more notifications, like when the car is unlocked, doors have been left open, etc. \n\n* -In my day to day driving there\u2019s basically been no difference in charging habits between the Taycan and my Model 3. I drive quite a bit and feel like I\u2019m basically charging at roughly the same intervals throughout the week. Even on road trips I feel like I\u2019m basically stopping the Taycan at roughly the same spots I\u2019d want to stop my Tesla at. The only notable charging difference between the two is the Tesla fast charging experience being 5X better than the non-Tesla experience. But for those worried about day to day range or taking a step backwards coming from a Tesla, so far it\u2019s been a non-issue for me. \n\n**Driving Experience:** \n\nI\u2019ve driven quite a few obtainable sports cars and I\u2019ve always generally been on the look for the \u201cperfect\u201d vehicle for myself. With a lot of vehicles they start off great, but as you drive them the luster wears off and you start to realize the vehicle\u2019s limitations. With a lot of sports cars there\u2019s some compromise in day to day living or practicality that starts to add up. With a lot of daily-able vehicles there\u2019s a lack of character or \u201cspecialness\u201d which makes you start lusting for a sports car after a while. \n\nThe more I drive my Taycan the more I like it. I think it\u2019s because this is one of the first true all around, no compromise cars that I\u2019ve driven. In day to day use the car is supremely comfortable. The air suspension makes it feel like you\u2019re almost gliding along the road and the car is so isolated from wind and other NVH that it\u2019s like you\u2019re in your own little bubble of comfort. \n\nWhen you want to start driving spiritedly the car basically turns itself into a sport car and has this great combo of feeling competent, accessible, safe, and fun all at the same time. In my C8 Stingray, which I would characterize as fairly easy car to drive quickly in, I would always hit this point where the car would be \u201cfun\u201d but as the speeds got higher the next level of \u201cfun\u201d meant that you were being dangerous or taking risks that you shouldn\u2019t be taking on a public road. This often meant I would have to back off for the sake of being responsible, but it always felt like there was this level of enjoyment in the C8 that could never be reached on a public road. \n\nIn the Taycan you can push that envelope of fun a lot further without feeling like you\u2019re being dangerous or completely irresponsible. So that range of \u201cfun\u201d in the Taycan is a bit broader and you feel like you can actually get quite a bit more out of the car. This isn\u2019t to say that the Taycan is a more capable car than the C8 or anything like that, just that the C8 has a lot of performance and character that\u2019s hidden away for track use only, and the Taycan somehow allows you to bring a lot of that performance out on the street. \n\nWhat has really stood out to me is I feel like I can do things in this vehicle that I wouldn\u2019t feel safe doing in other cars. Throwing it into corners at stupid speeds, being very aggressive with throttle and brake inputs, etc. I think a lot of this has to do with the rear wheel steer, active roll bars, and other suspension magic that this car has, but it really makes a difference in what you feel confident doing in this car. I tried the whole \u201cslow car fast\u201d thing in my Elise and I think the Taycan delivers a much more rewarding experience all together. It\u2019s fast, engaging, controllable, safe, and precise all at the same time. \n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is you do feel the car\u2019s weight in more \u201cnormal\u201d driving situations, but when you really start to push it on a twisty or technical road all of the inputs are setup in a way that helps the car mask its weight. I would say the car is worst on higher speed sweepers, because the extra weight means that you feel more G\u2019s than you\u2019d feel in in a lighter car. But on very technical roads all of the suspension magic hides the weight very well, and on the highway that extra weight turns into more stability and confidence.\n\nI think the biggest compliment I can give the Taycan is I\u2019ve driven this car on basically all of the same roads as my old C8 and I legitimately do not feel like I am missing anything in terms of performance or enjoyment compared to my C8. Yes the experience is a little different and the C8 is fun in some other ways (engine noise, being able to take the top down, etc), but I can also be in my Taycan every day, bring 3 other people with me on a canyon road, etc. So the fact that the Taycan delivers C8 levels of street enjoyment in something so practical is just astounding to me. \n\nWhat I particularly like about the Taycan is being able to drive it in a normal setting, finding an \u201cinteresting\u201d stretch of road, throwing it into sports plus and blasting down that stretch, and then returning to normal the second the road or traffic takes away the ability to drive spiritedly. To me it\u2019s like being in something very close to the ease of a Tesla all of the time, but being able to turn it into a C8-like driving experience whenever I want to. It\u2019s the best of a lot of worlds all in one vehicle and that\u2019s very cool thing to experience. \n\n**Conclusion TL;DR: \n(Yes I know this a long post)**\n\nIf you can only have one car I think the Taycan is one of the best all around cars out there. It looks like a special vehicle, has a reasonable level of practicality, has some of the best handling I\u2019ve experienced thus far, and the 4S and above cars are all properly fast. I also think the car has great steering feel and its sheer competence and precision creates a very rewarding driving experience through and through. Coming from a Tesla Model 3 Performance, I personally feel like there has been very little compromise aside from having to deal with the non-Tesla charging network. \n\nNow having owned one for a while, my perceived value of this vehicle is not anywhere near as high as Porsche\u2019s pricing. I don\u2019t necessarily think these cars are worth more than $120K or so just given the build quality issues I\u2019ve had and the two generation old tech these have. So I would not recommend buying one at MSRP unless you happen to get a great lease deal (which seems doable on these depending on model, time of year, etc). The good news is the depreciation on these is huge so it\u2019s not uncommon to get a lightly used CPO car for $60-$100K off MSRP and I think that\u2019s 100% the move on these. \n\nIf you\u2019re a strong car enthusiast I think this is the only EV that will properly scratch your enthusiast itch. BMW\u2019s cars are compromised ICE platforms with EV tech shoved into them. The Hyundai Ioniq N is a souped up crossover . Mercedes\u2019 vehicles look like garbage. Teslas are soul-less and fall apart. Lucids just don\u2019t look sporty enough to really get that emotional connection, regardless of how competent they are. \n\nThere\u2019s supposed to be a lot of enthusiast EV\u2019s dropping in 2025 and 2026, but we\u2019re nearing the end of 2024 and I feel like a lot of manufacturers haven\u2019t announced anything that will be available soon. The Cayman EV will of course be the first properly viable sports/enthusiast EV available, but until that is announced, and until other manufacturers put something else on the table, I can see the Taycan being the best enthusiast EV for the next couple of years. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s better than some of the more sporty ICE vehicles out there, but it has honestly scratched most of my itches as a car enthusiast and I don\u2019t find myself consistently browsing Cargurus for my next \u201cbuy\u201d thanks to having this vehicle in my garage.",

    "selftext": "I don't like the WRX. Were it not for the manual transmission and awd system I think we'd be comparing it to a Kia Forte GT. The interior sucks, there's no noise insulation, the speakers suck, you have to buy an armrest, the powertrain might as well be 20 years old,  their reliability is overstated and the styling has been getting sabotaged for years. Yet, it's one of the best selling enthusiast cars on the market. \n\nSubaru is able to get away with these insulting efforts because they're the only game in town.\n\nSay you want a fun car but you're a frugal family man that lives in a place where it snows. What are your options? Family knocks out 2 seaters. Snow knocks out everything with rwd. Frugality and risk aversion knock out anything German. That leaves you with WRX, Elantra N and Civic Si. WRX costs the same amount but has AWD making it the clear winner.\n\nThe decision is made before these buyers walk into a dealership. WRX has 4 seats, 4 doors, awd and a low sticker price. It doesn't need to do or be good at anything else because it's the only car that offers that fulfills that combination of requirements. \n\nYou see it in many other areas of the car market. Mediocre cars achieve legendary status simply because they're the only game in town. Often it's not a result of effort but rather neglect. Most of these are only here because the manufacturer abandoned the car but kept the factory running. \n\n* Toyota Tacoma/4Runner - Only reliable midsized body on frame vehicles. Nearly 20 years without an update. The more they ignored it the better it sold.\n* Jeep Wrangler - Was for years the only hardcore off-roader.\n* Mercedes G-Wagon - I don't even know where to start. This could be its own separate post.\n* Ford Maverick - The only small hybrid truck. Sold for $10k over sticker for the first 3 years of production.\n* Subaru WRX - The only enthusiast car with AWD under $33k. \n* Any Tesla - Bad interiors, poor reliability and extremely volatile prices. They get away with it because they're the best performing and cheapest ev in town.\n\nThese cars don't have competition and thus have no incentive to improve. What would it take for the WRX to be dethroned? Is anyone up to the challenge? Would an AWD Civic Si be all it takes to dethrone this epic legend? If the WRX had a serious competitor would they put more effort into the WRX or say \"aww, sales have tanked, let's scrape it\". ",

    "title": "The problem with one pedal driving - after experience with Teslas and other EV's",
    "selftext": "I test drove a lot of EV's after deciding to purchase one last fall. I tried the one pedal driving which sounds nice in theory, but I found it frightening to use for this reason.\n\nOne pedal driving lets you decelerate at a max of \\~0.2g's using the EV motor's regeneration versus \\~1.0g's for mechanical brakes. This is fine for most scenarios, when traffic is predictable and visibility is great.\n\nHowever, Imagine a scenario where traffic is slowing at a reasonable rate \\~0.1g's (you cannot brake at \\~0.1g's unless you're feathering the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, because 1-pedal driving) but there's a sudden need for the car to come to a complete stop. A normal braking implementation would require the driver to simply mash the brake pedal to get full stopping power, because they were already on the brakes. For 1-pedal driving, it requires you to shuffle your foot to the brake pedal to get more braking power, taking additional precious time when you're coming to an emergency stop, not to mention how confusing it could be in panic situations.\n\nMost other EV vehicle manufacturers (VW/Hyundai/Benz/BMW) will let you adjust the regen settings so that it's possible to hover on the brakes while coasting to prepare for emergency stopping. But Tesla's on the other hand does not let you adjust the regen. Why you might ask?\n\n  \nIt turns out Tesla's brake pedal is purely mechanical, as opposed to others using a blended braking system where it seamlessly switches from regen/mechanical braking depending on how the brake pedal is depressed. In order for Tesla to meet EPA range estimates, it forces you to have 1-pedal driving with max regen enabled.\n\n  \nIf you've ever wondered why Tesla's have such a wide gap between itself and the cars in front during traffic, it's because of this unintuitive and dangerous implementation. I try to avoid following/being followed by Tesla's in traffic because of this reason. \n\nI believe manufacturers should educate consumers which scenarios are fit for 1-pedal driving, instead of posing as a better alternative, before more consumers learn about its pitfalls the hard way. This is coming from someone that likes/owns an EV; Misleading consumers this way will not help drive EV adoption and will cause distrust of EV's in general.\n\nEdit: A lot of you are stating rear endings are completely avoidable by not following too closely. Let\u2019s look an a [NHTSA report on rear ending](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/analyses20of20rear-end20crashes20and20near-crashes20dot20hs2081020846.pdf).\n\nOn page 24: \u201cThe patterns across near-crash and incident events are are similar and suggest that the vast majority of drivers were not necessarily following too closely at the onset of lead-vehicle braking\u201d\n\nIt seems like the most relevant factor is response time and whether the lead vehicle initiated a sudden stop maneuver.\n\nSo please reddit,exercise a bit more critical thinking instead of falsely accusing me of bad driving.\n\nEdit 2: its called covering the brakes. Always be prepared for emergency stops when traffic is slowing down.",

    "title": "My 2-month Review of My 2024 Model 3 Performance",
    "selftext": "Haven't seen any personal reviews of the refreshed 2024 Tesla Model 3 Performance (M3P) here and I thought I would share a somewhat detailed review, and comparing to my prior daily, a 2019 G70 3.3T AWD advanced (18-inch wheels, brembo brakes, sports suspension). \n\n**Background**: I got a little weary with back-to-back recalls on the G70 (starter and turbocharger oil feed pipe), and also the closure of my local Genesis/Hyundai service center. I also wanted to try something a bit more performance oriented that also had a better phone app integration than the horrible Genesis connected services that I discontinued using after the free trial period, and so I test drove a 2023 Tesla M3P back in December when I had some idea that I wanted to get into a BEV. It was quite eye opening in that the suspension was surprisingly compliant for a sports sedan with 20 inch wheels, and felt more composed than my G70 which would get unsettled easily. The instant throttle response and the planted feel during corners with the low center of gravity and quick turn-in were also impressive, making the 4000-lbs car feel much more nimble than the G70. The main drawback was that the interior of the 2023 M3P was left wanting, feeling more like an economy car than a premium car. The sound of closing the door was probably the most offensive in that regard, and I had to open and close the driver door a dozen times in total disbelief at what I was hearing.  \n\nSubsequently, I had a chance to test drive the highland 2024 model 3 LR, which rectified all of the interior issues I had with the 2023, and it felt more premium, but I thought the suspension was too soft, and didn't like how it rolled in the corners. With those 2 test drives, I bid my time being aware of the camouflaged highland M3P being planned to be released soon, with many leaked upgrades like bucket seats, different front fascia, and adaptive suspension. \n\n**Ordering**: On launch day I saw the plethora of youtube reviews during lunch time and ordered within the hour of launch - stealth grey with white interior, which qualified for the EV tax credit. [This review by Jason Cammisa in the Carmudgeon series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xj0R4MyDhE) sealed the deal for me; I respect Jason's opinions and although he got quite  a bit of flak for his cybertruck review, I trusted his opinion of the M3P, knowing I was ordering without having test drove the M3P. In short, his claim was that it's a better daily than a G80 BMW M3 while offering similar 0-60 performance figures, while being a fraction of the cost. It took around 6 weeks from order date to delivery of my car. However with all of the recent Tesla layoffs, trying to get a hold of any customer service through the app was impossible, but thankfully my situation was as simple as it could be, with no trade-in and paying in cash, so I didn't have any urgent questions other than trying to nail down my delivery date. \n\n**Pickup**: As expected, picking up the car was as simple as it could be once the delivery date was scheduled. I inspected the car and besides some imperfections on the hood which subsequently got fixed by Tesla, I was happy with the panel gaps after spending approximately 90 minutes going through it in detail. I paid through the app, they put on my plates, and I drove back home. \n\n**Acceleration**: All car enthusiasts know by now how fast M3Ps are. It has a 2.9 sec 0-60 with 1-ft rollout but it seems to be somewhat conservative as few are getting that without the rollout in certain conditions. I probably drive 90% of the time in standard mode vs. insane mode because standard mode still gives you a sub 4 sec 0-60, and I don't need the hypersensitive throttle response for daily driving. The only time I would use insane mode is when I'm tearing up some back roads or trying to get ahead of some traffic. What's interesting vs the 2023 M3P is that the initial instant torque is smoother in application, and so it's less nauseating imo. The fact that there is no engine oil temp to warm up means that I can just launch out of my development, which initially felt so alien to me. One of those things you really begin to appreciate. Same for technically having no break-in period. \n\n**Suspension and Handling**: The new adaptive suspension is *chef's kiss*, with the car soaking up most of the smaller bumps with finesse. There are times when larger bumps end up traveling through the cabin, and overall the car is still definitely on the firm side, but I am really impressed with the suspension. I bought some 18 inch Tsportlines for the colder season and I bet with some AS tires, it would feel even better at the expense of grip. The 20 inch PZeroes are surprisingly good and can grip for days. Cornering feels planted and well controlled, again much more nimble feeling than my prior G70. To me this is the highlight of the 2024 M3P. Great balance of performance and comfort. \n\n**Brakes**: One of the shortcomings of this car - brake feel is worse than my G70, and it does not give you confidence that you can stop on a dime, even with these upgraded brakes. Given that I use regen for most of my stops during daily driving, I don't think I'll do anything with the brakes, but anyone who tracks these should seriously consider changing out the pads. I did bed the brakes with a dozen hard stops which helped improve the feel, but I think the G70 wins here still and probably any other ICE sport sedan. \n\n**Practicality**: Clear win vs. the G70, with much more useable back seats and a much larger trunk along with a usable frunk. \n\n**Phone app integration**: Another highlight for the Tesla - after being only accustomed to the crappy Hyundai/Genesis/Toyota apps, this was mind blowing to me how much better and more seamless Tesla's phone app integration was. Most of the key controls can be done remotely, even viewing the sentry camera feed live through my app (which is an extra 99/year that comes along with other perks like being able to stream spotify/netflix/youtube without having to use my mobile hotspot on the phone- feel like it's worth it). Cabin overheat protection is also nice. \n\n**Interior**: Much more premium experience than the 2023 M3P and almost on par with the 2019 G70 interior. The bucket seats feel nice, almost all surfaces are soft touch, and materials have a quality feel to them. Probably not as good as BMW or Audi luxury equivalents, but definitely befitting of its premium-level price. The quietness of the drive is also notable vs. the G70, with the lack of any engine noise and the double-pane windows blocking outside noise. It is a comfortable and relaxing place to drive daily. Some have complained of interior squeaks/rattles which continue to plague the model 3. I do hear occasional rattles from the dash but only when I drive over rough roads, and thankfully >90% of my time spent driving is rattle-free. May have to watch and see as we enter the colder months. \n\n**Charging**: I set up a tesla wall charger prior to my pickup, and as expected, extremely convenient to charge overnight and not have to go to a gas station to fill up with 93 gas. I'm paying around 16 cents/KWh I believe, so around 8 USD per charge session if I did my math correctly going from 20-80%. I'm averaging around 270 Wh/mi which is also not bad. \n\nI think that's it for now. Here's a [pic](https://imgur.com/a/XrPhFNn) after a recent wash.",

    "title": "Here's how many Tesla owners actually goes back to gas....11%. 70% gets into another Tesla.",
    "selftext": "Great video by Alex on Autos analyzing a much better data set to give us the real picture. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/NOpem2z-33c?si=1MtmsjyAnXAvae5s\n\n\nAlex's write up:\n\"So how many Tesla owners REALLY went back to gas? Well, thanks to one of our viewers, we got out hands on the best data possible and the answer is: Not many. In 2023, just 11% of Tesla owners that swapped into something else went back to gas. Yep, 11%, not \"more than half\" as some reporting has said. Let's dive into the data and see what Edmunds and others got wrong. \n\nThe key thing about Edmunds' data is that it's collected from dealerships. If you didn't know, Tesla (and others) sell direct. This is critical because a whopping 70% of Tesla owners or lessees that swapped into another car, got another Tesla. \n\nWhat did the rest do? 13% swapped for another EV, 11% went back to gas, 4% opted for a mild or full hybrid, 2% got a PHEV and 1% opted for a diesel. \nSo where does this data come from? It's from S&P Global Mobility, the gold standard for loyalty, sales, and conquest data. They pull all the car registration data every month from every state and crunch the numbers. (Yep, your registration data is far from private.) They match households that dispose of a car (whether that's a trade-in, sale, end of lease, gifted to someone, etc) and then see what those same households buy or lease next. \n\nFrom January 1, 2023 to February 29, 2024 (the extra 2 months ensure that replacements have been captured since sometimes it takes a while to sell a car and replace it, or replace a car and sell your old one) a total of 60,022 Teslas were \"disposed\" of in the USA. (Industry term.) \n\nOf those 60,000 Teslas leaving garages in America, 42,244 new Teslas took their place. What about the rest? 7,710 went back to gas, 6,385 got another EV, 2,344 opted for hybrid power, 946 gave a PHEV a whirl, and 393 opted for a diesel. \n\nUnlike some outlets, we need to \u201cqualify\u201d this data with some asterisks. Between 2008 and 2023, 80% of Teslas ever sold in the USA were sold between 2020 and 2023. That\u2019s why the \u201cTeslas disposed of\u201d number seems so low at 60,022, most just aren\u2019t old enough to even be at the end of their lease. Currently some 70%+ of all Teslas on the road are under 4 years old. This means that the Teslas people are getting rid of skew heavily toward Model S, X and early Model 3s. The oldest Model Ys in America today are just over 4 years old. \n\nWhen comparing data, beware that Edmunds does not say whether they combine mild and full hybrids, or mild hybrids with ICE and they don\u2019t mention diesel at all. \nAnd there you have it. That\u2019s the full story of Tesla trades.\"\n\n",

    "title": "I rented a Mercedes EQS 580 4MATIC on Turo ",
    "selftext": "As the title says, I just rented a Mercedes EQS 580 on Turo, and I wanted to share my impressions.\n\nTo give a bit of background, I have owned primarily \"driver's cars\" from the 1990s. E30 BMW, Acura Integra GS-R, that kind of stuff. I appreciate cars from this era for their good blend of ownership experience, driving dynamics, and value. That said, my taste is eclectic, and I've driven a wide variety of cars old and new, ranging from a 1960 MG MGA to a 2015 Corvette Z06. I have probably rented 20 cars between Turo and DriveShare over the years. I mention this because many of my impressions are based on my experience with cars from previous decades, and in the ways those cars differ from a modern car, for better or for worse.\n\nI was intrigued by the EQS and its reputation as one of the more luxurious and better built EVs. I've read a lot of negative opinions about the styling, but personally it's one of my favorite things about the car. I like when manufacturers step outside the box and build a product with a singular purpose - in this case aerodynamic efficiency, even if this means deviating from the usual car proportions. This type of function over form engineering used to be a Mercedes-Benz trademark, so it's neat to see it reflected here.\n\nPrior to this, my EV experience had been with a Tesla Model 3 as passenger, and as driver in a Polestar 2.\n\nOverall, my impression was of a car that was fun to rent, though perhaps not to own. There are many features to delight you and impress your friends - \"gimmicks\" one might call them. Things like the voice-activated sunshade and customizable light band that goes around the interior are neat at first, but I imagine the novelty wears off quickly. I question what the out of warranty ownership experience would be like owning a car with so many gadgets. Most of my gripes (such as the bunker-like feeling and small glass area) could apply to modern cars in general, and aren't an EV-specific failing. The interior materials seemed nice enough but the design was too flamboyant for my taste, and I found myself preferring the minimalist restraint of the Polestar 2 interior. There were some creaks from the interior when going over sharp cracks that I did not notice in the Polestar.\n\nAnyway, here are my notes on the experience:\n\n-First impression, it's not as quiet as you might think. The A/C fan sounds like a jet airliner taking off. Road and wind noise is less than 2012 Lexus RX350, but not by much. Maybe actually slightly worse isolation from outside ambient noise.\n\n-Seats rather firm for a luxury car. My point of reference is sprung seats on vintage cars, which in my opinion are much comfier. Has large side bolsters that hold you in during cornering.\n\n-Dashboard is high, poor visibility all around. But doesn't matter (arguably) due to excellent sensors and 3D camera.\n\n-Had a scary incident where it slammed on the brakes when in reverse thinking there was something in the way, but there wasn't.\n\n-The cornering is confident with not much body roll. Tires give up easily and start squealing due to 5,500 lb.+ curb weight.\n\n-Ride quality still not on the level of something like a Lincoln Town Car or old Mercedes. Some creaks from cabin when going over sharp bumps. Flush door handles are gimmicky and feel cheap to the touch, though the actual door closure itself sounds solid - no doubt something engineered in.\n\n-Fast, especially at low speeds.\n\n-Self-driving is awesome, really good for commuting. Car can steer itself on highway and change lanes by itself, all you have to do is actuate the turn signal. Also will pace the car in front, and can change how many car lengths you want.\n\n-Easier to use voice control for most features rather than delving into touchscreen. Interaction with radio and A/C is inferior to buttons, takes multiple presses of finicky touchpad on steering wheel to change radio preset, for example, instead of just pressing a button.\n\nI'm sure some of these things like the automated driving will be old hat to those of you used to these kind of systems, but for me coming from 90s cars, they were quite neat. By the same token there were things like ride quality, visibility, and user interface that I think are better on older cars, but again, this is mainly an artifact of modern cars and their greatly enhanced safety and efficiency more than any EQS or EV specific failing.",

It reveals just how differently two leaders in self-driving technology \u201csee\u201d the world:\n\nTesla vs Waymo\nCameras - 8 vs 14\nRadar - 0 vs 6\nLidar - 0 vs 4\nTotal sensors - 8 vs 24\n\nKey Take-aways\n\n1. Minimalism vs. Redundancy\nTesla bets on an 8-camera, vision-only stack. Waymo layers cameras + radar + LiDAR (24 sensors) for high-confidence perception.\n\n\n2. Cost & Scalability\nFewer sensors mean lower BOM and easier mass production for Tesla\u2014but also heavier reliance on advanced AI to make up for missing depth data.\n\n\n3. Edge-Case Handling\nMulti-modal sensing (Waymo) can offer robustness in low-light, glare, and inclement weather. Vision-only (Tesla) must solve these purely in software.\n\n\n4. Compute Requirements\nMore sensors = richer data = greater processing demands. Waymo\u2019s stack leans on hefty onboard compute; Tesla optimizes around its custom FSD chips and over-the-air neural-network updates.\n\nWhich philosophy will win out as we close in on Level 4/5 autonomy\u2014 AI-centric minimalism or sensor-fusion redundancy? And how should startups or tier-1 suppliers and OEMs position themselves in this debate?\n\nDrop your thoughts below! \ud83d\udc47",

    "selftext": "Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal \n\nThis looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.\n\nBrief summary\n\nThe U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar \u201cminerals for security\u201d agreement.\n\nTrump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.\n\nWhy this deserves investor attention\n\nKEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS \n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.\n\nIf the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.\n\nCapital Flows Could Change \n\nIf U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.\n\n Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities \n\nThe Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.\n\nImpact on Tech & EV Sectors \n\nOEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.\n\nCURRENT MARKET REACTION: \n\nGlobal mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear\n\nMarket Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)\n\nMy recommendations from an investment perspective\n\nLong-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.\n\nMedium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.\n\nShort-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.\n\nMacro observation If the United States to \u201cresource diplomacy\u201d as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.\n\nSome of my questions\n\nHas anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?\n\nDo you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a \u201cpaper peace\u201d?\n\nBigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?",

    "title": "Uber in Talks With Its Founder, Travis Kalanick, to Fund Self-Driving Car Deal",
    "selftext": ">Uber is increasingly grappling with competition from self-driving taxi services like Waymo. Now the ride-hailing giant is taking more action to deal with that threat.\n\n>Uber is in talks with\u00a0Travis Kalanick, the company\u2019s co-founder who was\u00a0forced out in a boardroom coup\u00a0eight years ago this month, to help fund his acquisition of the U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese autonomous vehicle company, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The company, Pony.ai, was founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 but has its main presence in China, and has permits to operate robot taxis and trucks in the United States and China.\n\n>The talks are preliminary, said the people, who were not authorized to speak about the confidential conversations. Mr. Kalanick will run Pony if the deal is completed, they said. It is unclear what role, if any, Uber would take in Pony as an investor.\n\n>Financial details of the potential transaction could not be determined. Pony went public last year in the United States, raising $260 million in a share sale. Its market capitalization stands around $4.5 billion.\n\n>If the deal goes through, Mr. Kalanick, 48, will remain in his\u00a0day job running CloudKitchens, a virtual restaurant start-up that he founded after leaving Uber in 2017. He would also work more closely with Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over as Uber\u2019s chief executive after Mr. Kalanick\u2019s ouster.\n\n>The discussions are the starkest sign yet that Uber is under pressure from Waymo, the driverless car unit spun out of Google, and other autonomous car services. This month, Tesla also unveiled\u00a0a limited robot taxi service\u00a0in Austin, Texas. Over time, these autonomous vehicle services may replace or eat into rides from human drivers. In cities like San Francisco, where robot taxi services are available, the vehicles have become ubiquitous and are popular.\n\n>An Uber spokesman declined to comment on deal talks and said, \u201cUber has a platform strategy, and we intend to work with multiple players in the U.S. and around the world who can safely bring autonomous technology to the world.\u201d\n\n>Devon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kalanick, did not immediately have a comment. Pony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>When Mr. Kalanick was Uber\u2019s chief executive, the company tried developing autonomous vehicle technology. It then\u00a0bought Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up run by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer. Google later sued Mr. Levandowski for theft of trade secrets and sued Uber to bar it from using its self-driving technology.\n\n>Under Mr. Khosrowshahi, Uber has taken a different tack to self-driving cars. The company has struck roughly 18 partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies like Wayve, May Mobility and WeRide to bring pilot programs for driverless car services into Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\n\n>The goal, Mr. Khosrowshahi has said in podcast interviews, has been to put \u201cas many cars on Uber\u2019s network as possible.\u201d He has maintained that while autonomous vehicles are growing steadily, ride-hailing networks will have both human and robot drivers for years.\n\n>Today, Uber both competes and collaborates with Waymo. In Phoenix, riders can order a Waymo car through Uber\u2019s app. In Austin, Waymo\u2019s robot taxis don the Uber logo. But Waymo has also expanded into more cities, potentially biting into Uber\u2019s business. And in San Francisco, Waymo customers are required to use the Waymo app to order rides.\n\n>Uber is also watching Elon Musk, who has promised a wider rollout of Tesla\u2019s self-driving taxis and has declined to team up with Uber.\n\n>Mr. Kalanick has grown interested in robotics over the past year, according to two people who have spoken with him. He has brought robots into some of his CloudKitchens to prepare food for customers and has experimented with automated kitchens building food bowls for delivery. He has also become enamored with robots that traverse streets to deliver food to people.\n\n>Pony.ai has been in a precarious situation. In 2019, President Trump\u2019s first administration passed an executive order aimed at eliminating reliance on Chinese technologies in American services, citing national security concerns.\n\n>This year, the Commerce Department passed a rule that forbids autonomous vehicle software used in the United States to be operated or maintained by any Chinese entity. The department set a deadline for March 2026.\n\n>Pony has prepared its U.S. subsidiary of the business for a sale or spinoff. Its engineers \u201cforked\u201d the source code of its technology in 2022, and the software running on autonomous cars has for the past few years been developed in the United States and not in China, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\n>Apart from Uber, Mr. Kalanick is working with other investors to finance a possible transaction of Pony.\n\n>Mr. Kalanick\u2019s early years at Uber were marked by clashes with regulators and other Silicon Valley executives, led by his pugnacious streak. Despite his reputation - or perhaps because of it - Mr. Kalanick brute-forced Uber into a dominant position in the ride-hailing market and toppled traditional taxi services in the process.\n\n>Since his acrimonious exit from Uber in 2017, Mr. Kalanick has kept a low profile, working on CloudKitchens and quietly investing in other start-ups. Only more recently has he begun reappearing in the public eye, making a guest appearance at the \u201cAll-In\u201d podcast\u2019s\u00a0conference\u00a0event in Los Angeles last September and at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration parties in Washington in January.\n\n>Over the past year, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Khosrowshahi began speaking more frequently, two people said. They discussed robotics, food delivery and the growth of Uber Eats and CloudKitchens, along with the rise of self-driving cars. Those talks, along with the passage of time, have led to a thawing of the once icy relationship between the two men, the people said.\n\nLink: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/technology/uber-travis-kalanick-self-driving-car-deal.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/technology/uber-travis-kalanick-self-driving-car-deal.html)",

    "selftext": ">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.\n\n>\n\n>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.\n\n>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.\n\n>\u201cWe have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,\u201d Altman said last week on the \u201cUncapped With Jack Altman\u201d podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, \u201cIf our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\n>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI\u2019s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.\n\n>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he\u2019s building a direct competitor, xAI, that\u2019s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)\n\n>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk\u2019s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.\n\n>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.\n\n>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in \u201cgeneralizable\u201d A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.\n\n>(OpenAI\u2019s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)\n\n>\u201cI think he really gets it,\u201d Altman said of President Trump\u2019s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) \u201cI think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.\u201d\n\n>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: \u201cI have become a bit more, jaded isn\u2019t the right word, but it\u2019s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.\u201d\n\n>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: \u201cDo you believe that, when you read those things?\u201d\n\nLink: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/business/dealbook/openai-autonomous-vehicles-musk-tesla.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/business/dealbook/openai-autonomous-vehicles-musk-tesla.html)",

    "selftext": "This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nToday is mainly second-day movers from news yesterday.\n\nNews: [Iran Israel War Updates](https://apnews.com/live/iran-israel-war-updates-6-24-2025)\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- NHTSA pressed Tesla for more information after robotaxi incidents caught on camera showed lane departures and speeding in Austin (this hasn't actually moved the stock but interesting to see how this ultimately plays out). TSLA surged massively yesterday (325->359) because of the robotaxi launch on Sunday, and streamers caught some traffic violations. Most obvious catalyst here is if regulators pull Robotaxi out of Austin, but I doubt that will happen. Also interseted to see if we move up for a second day. \n\n[**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)/[**XLE (Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XLE&p=d)\\-President Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating a ceasefire he helped broker yesterday. We saw the market move up yesterday (and oil fall) due to Trump saying that the Israel and Iran conflict was set to end in a ceasefire. This may be a telegraphed move to say that the ceasefire might not hold. If so then we may see a surge in oil if the conflict continues and the market fall. Overall I'm mainly interested in the moves of oil because this actually hasn't budged VIX too much. \n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\\-Crypto \u201crules of the road\u201d framework unveiled by Senators. The bipartisan GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68\u201330 to regulate stableCs. CRCL moved up to $299 yesterday and then sell off after a MASSIVE move since the IPO- I think that the selloff from the move was saved primarily due to Trump's announcement of the Iran/Israel ceasefire (which caused the entire market to move up). We might see another selloff today- still short biased in this and not interested in this long. \n\nRandom risks I'm thinking of that could kill momentum: The bill now has to pass the House; dilution by the STABLE Act could change issuer oversight, and international competition (Tether) could beat this in the longrun. \n\n[**NTRS (Northern Trust Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NTRS&p=d)\\-Northern Trust shares surged Friday \\~8% after reports that Bank of New York Mellon approached the company about a potential merger. Overall wasn't an extremely interesting catalyst but NTRS said they're committed to remaining independent, so we may see additional updates on this. (Most companies that are committed to remaining independent are holding out for a higher buyout price).\n\nEarnings: FDX",

It's already outrageous \n\nTSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \\~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 \n\nIn a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected \n\nLong view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly\n\nShort view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher\n\n\n\nDo you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?\n\nAnyone planning to wait for a pullback ($320-330) before getting in?

And it's awesome.\n\nSource: [https://www.carscoops.com/2025/06/autonomous-id-buzz-ad-is-ready-to-battle-tesla-and-waymo/](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/06/autonomous-id-buzz-ad-is-ready-to-battle-tesla-and-waymo/)\n\nAlong with being an actual purpose design and built robotaxi instead of just a Jerrry-rigged older model, it has three things Tesla doesn't:\n\n1. Nine LiDAR sensors (and five radars- so it doesn't crash into things).\n2. Space for actual passengers- a key feature to taxis.\n3. Level 4 autonomy.\n\nI love the Tesla fan perspective on LiDAR: \"It's expensive\" and \"It's not needed with an AI-driven 100% vision system\". Yeah right. Let's see it work then. We've only been waiting a decade now. If Tesla can solve all of the world's hardest technological problems and are the world's best at manufacturing (as Elon states), then why can't they design and build their own simple LiDAR sensors for their cars? They can't make a better version of the sensor I can buy online for a few hundred bucks that goes into a golf range finder but they are going to make a humanoid robot? One of those things is really hard to do. The other isn't.\n\nTesla is so far behind in this space. I can't believe there are still enough gullible people still falling for the narrative to pump the stock. Their own internal analysis said this endeavor would lose money. At this point I think there are only three types of people:\n\n1. Aware.\n2. Blind Believers (aka- cult members).\n3. Traders that are aware of the believers and make money off the stock because of them.",

But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.\n\nMeanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.\n\nThe Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.\n\nDid consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong\u00a0spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for\u00a0trade developments\u00a0as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.\n\nIt\u2019s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.\n\n# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts\n\nFed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up prices.\n\nBut the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after\u00a0May inflation data\u00a0came in lower than economists expected. Despite\u00a0comments from President Donald Trump\u00a0urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.\n\nThe\u00a0CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.\n\nAfter the meeting concludes on Wednesday,\u00a0Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0will provide more insight into the central bank\u2019s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.\n\nOn Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health\u00a0Consumer spending\u00a0makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday\u2019s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a\u00a0need for more housing inventory.\n\n# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday\n\nAfter months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as\u00a0early as Sunday, June 22. \"We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,\" Musk wrote.\n\nThe introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is\u00a0well-positioned to lead the market\u00a0in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.\n\nDespite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.\n\nLennar\u2019s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's\u00a0warning of weakness\u00a0in the housing market in the prior quarter.\u00a0 The scheduled Friday reports from\u00a0accounting firm Accenture\u00a0(ACN) and\u00a0online car seller CarMax\u00a0(KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.\n\n# This Week\u2019s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 16**\n\n* Data to Watch: Empire State manufacturing survey (June)\n* Key Earnings: Lennar\n\n**Tuesday, June 17**\n\n* U.S. retail sales (May)\n* Homebuilder confidence (June)\n* Key Earnings: Jabil (JBL), John Wiley & Sons (WLY), and La-Z-Boy (LZB)\n* More Data to Watch: Import/export price index (May), Industrial production/capacity utilization (May), Business inventories (April)\n\n**Wednesday, June 18**\n\n* Housing starts (May)\n* FOMC interest-rate decision\n* Federal Reserve Chair Powell press conference\n* Key Earnings: GMS (GMS)\n* More Data to Watch: Initial jobless claims (Week ending June 14)\n\n**Thursday, June 19**\n\n* Financial markets closed for the Juneteenth holiday\n* Key Earnings: Smith & Wesson Brands (SWBI)\n\n**Friday, June 20**\n\n* Leading economic indicators (May)\n* Key Earnings: Accenture, Kroger (KR), Darden Restaurants (DRI), and CarMax\n* More Data to Watch: Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey (June)",

    "selftext": "Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is taking steps that would make it easier for automakers to deploy-self driving cars without driver controls, a potential boon to the ambitions of Tesla Inc. and rivals looking to put robotaxis on US roads in the near future.\n\nCurrent rules require automakers that want to deploy self-driving cars designed without a steering wheel or brake pedals to seek an exemption from federal safety standards that effectively require that new cars have human driving controls. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will \u201cstreamline\u201d that exemption process, which under current policy has resulted in lengthy processing times that can last years, the agency said in a letter posted to its website on Friday.\n\nAs a result of the changes, NHTSA \u201canticipates reaching decisions on most exemption requests within months rather than years,\u201d NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in the letter.\n\nThe move takes aim at one of the biggest regulatory hurdles facing Tesla\u2019s plan to field its self-driving Cybercab in large numbers. The vehicle, revealed on a Hollywood studio lot last year, lacks a steering wheel and foot pedals, jeopardizing Tesla\u2019s ability to introduce it without an exemption from the agency.\n\nThe vehicle is a key part of Tesla\u2019s push into artificial intelligence and robotics that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said are critical to the company\u2019s future.\n\nTesla\u2019s shares touched a session high and rose 1.5% as of 12:29 p.m. in New York.\n\nTesla later this month plans to launch its initial robotaxi business in Austin, using self-driving Model Y SUVs overseen by remote operators. The company aims to eventually incorporate the purpose-built Cybercab into its fleet after Tesla begins producing them in large numbers next year.\n\nMusk, who donated more than $250 million to help President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection and until recently had led a sweeping push to slash government spending, has called for a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.\n\nMembers of Trump\u2019s transition team also planned to make creating a regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles a top priority, Bloomberg has reported.",

Too expensive. Right. And lawsuits are cheap. I think we all see where this is going. But here is the twist I see coming: Phony Stark will blame the libs (again).

    "selftext": "(Barron's) \n\nTesla stock was falling early Thursday as shares looked set to miss out on five daily gains in a row.\n\nShares of the electric vehicle maker were down 1.4% at $322 in premarket trading, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were both down 0.5%.\n\nShares eked out a 0.1% gain on Wednesday, the stock's fourth consecutive green move. Shares have risen 14.6% over that span. That left shares about $18 lower from levels before a public feud between President Trump and CEO Elon Musk broke out on social media\n\nThe feud sent shares down 17.3% over two days last week. In a Wednesday post on X, Musk said he regretted some of the things he said about President Donald Trump.\n\nThe rapid relationship repair let investors focus again on Tesla's robotaxi launch scheduled for this month. Musk also said Tuesday that June 22 was the target date for the start of service. He added that a Tesla might drive off the assembly line in Austin, Texas to pick up a paying robotaxi customer on June 28.\n\nThere is still a lot investors don't know about the launch. Things like how many cars will be used initially, how the system will be overseen, what the Tesla ride hailing app will look like, and if Tesla will invite people to use the network or if it will be open to anyone.\n\nMusk recently said the launch could start with as few as 10 vehicles and that teleoperators would be watching to ensure safety. Some investors have also speculated that early network usage would be invite only.\n\nHowever things begin, investors should have answers to those questions soon. After a successful initial launch, investors will want to know how the service will scale in Austin and other cities across the country.\n\nComing into Thursday trading, Tesla stock was down about 19% year to date but up about 91% over the past 12 months. Shares were also up about 37% since the company's April 22 first-quarter earnings report when management reiterated their goal to launch the robotaxi service in June.\n\nShares have been all over the place.

Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.\n\n[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \\~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.\n\n[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher. Again, nothing confirmed from Bezos or Amazon, so the move may fade if no formal announcement follows.\n\n**Earnings today:** [**ORCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d)",

    "title": "Will robots be the next smartphone?",
    "selftext": "Tesla appears to be undervalued given its potential to revolutionize the field of robotics for both business and personal use. Stock prices on Wall Street are based on expectations for the future; we must consider what the robotics world will soon look like.Robots have become an integral part of the automotive and semiconductor industries, but mass-produced autonomous robots could have a significant impact on society and Tesla stock.Despite personal concerns, the arrival of advanced robots seems inevitable and it is worth considering future investment opportunities. \n\nWill Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) robots be the next smartphone device for the mass market? Will they have the same impact on society as smartphones? In this article, we'll look at the robots Tesla is developing and whether we can profit from this potential shift.\n\nTo some extent, Wall Street bases its judgment on future profit expectations for stock prices. When we think about future prospects, we have to think about what the world will look like in 3, 5, or 10 years and what will happen to stock prices? This is obviously a very difficult question to answer, but we can make reasonable predictions about the overall growth of the emerging humanoid robotics industry.\n\nIgnoring the risks posed by AI and robots to the survival of the species, we can probably assume that the short-term risk is that China will continue to dominate Chinese EV sales, and that Tesla could face a very tough time in the Chinese market. However, global sales of electric vehicles continue to grow. However, as EVs continue to grow, Tesla will need something to differentiate itself, and that's where self-driving cars might come into play. I guess we'll see if that will fully materialize, and for now, it looks like advanced testing will take place in Austin, Texas. Let's move on to the next issue.\n\nChina has a monopoly on rare earth elements used in Tesla robots and electric cars. The U.S. government needs to break that monopoly by heavily funding domestic resources. According to Reuters, President Trump may be on the verge of passing the Defense Production Act to fund critical and rare earth elements. Of course, we are currently in the midst of various political waves that are clashing between Elon and President Trump. Trying to predict what will happen between the two of them is futile as they are both unknowns, but it's just something to be aware of. Another risk factor is that Tesla currently has a lot of production in China. If relations with the U.S. deteriorate further, there could be repercussions. That's an unknown to keep an eye on.\n\nI think Tesla Robotics as well as solutions from NVIDIA, Amazon and China are on their way and will materialize in the next few years. Regarding the potential market size, according to a Reuters article, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said, The age of robotics has arrived. People are paying attention. This is likely to be the biggest industry.\n\n\n\nSo will humanoid robots become as popular as smartphones? I think it's possible, and if we look at how Elon is transforming Optimus Prime in the factory, we'll have a clearer picture of the future in a few years.",

Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.\n\nA U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a\u00a0healthy jobs report\u00a0Friday.\n\nAfter markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500\u00a0back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as\u00a0Trump\u2019s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful\u201d budget bill amid\u00a0increasing criticism\u00a0from Tesla CEO and\u00a0former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.\n\n# Economists Look for Inflation\u2019s Impact in May CPI Report\n\nWednesday\u2019s expected release of the\u00a0Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u00a0will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs\u00a0will be a key topic in Friday\u2019s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before\u00a0leveling out in May. Consumers are\u00a0consistently worried\u00a0that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.\n\n# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market\n\nGameStop\u2019s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which\u00a0fired up the meme stock craze\u00a0in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it\u00a0bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its\u00a0retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies\u00a0centering their business models on buying bitcoin.\n\nAI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle\u2019s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and\u00a0SoftBank\u00a0as part of a joint venture known as\u00a0Stargate\u00a0to build AI infrastructure. Adobe\u2019s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the\u00a0company\u2019s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.\n\n# This Week\u2019s Calendar\n\n**Monday, June 9**\n\n* Wholesale inventories (April)\n* Apple\u2019s (AAPL) WWDC conference begins with CEO Tim Cook's keynote address and special event\n* Key Earnings: Casey\u2019s General Stores (CASY)\n\n**Tuesday, June 10**\n\n* NFIB Small Business Optimism Index (May)\n* Key Earnings: GameStop, J.M.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Musk Blinks First in Bitter Trump Feud That Cost Him $34 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/musk-blinks-first-in-bitter-trump-feud-that-cost-him-34-billion)\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to \"cool things down\". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.\n\n[**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.\n\n[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \\~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.\n\n[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.",

KILL the BILL,\" Musk\u00a0posted on X\u00a0on Wednesday.\n\nMusk\u00a0added, \"If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!\"\n\nThe vocal criticism is irking Trump, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were \"caught off guard\" by Musk's latest broadsides.\n\nTesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.\n\nThe comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week,\u00a0angrily\u00a0posting Tuesday that it was a \"disgusting abomination.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\" he said.\n\n\"Shame on those\" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.\n\nBloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the\u00a0federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.\n\nMusk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a\u00a0Congressional Budget Office estimation\u00a0of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.\n\nThe nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.\n\nThe formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.\n\nMusk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.\n\nRead more:\u00a0How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance\n\nBut demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing\u00a0some Tesla owners to become alienated\u00a0by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.\n\nTesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating\u00a0250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",

Recap Investopedia's coverage of last Friday's trading here. The week also brought the latest set of trade ructions, with President Donald Trump on Friday raising fresh questions about the state of affairs with China.\n\nIn addition to a jobs report due Friday, investors also will be watching for reports on job openings and private-sector payrolls. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit and consumer credit levels will be in focus, as will manufacturing and services industry data, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), construction spending, and factory orders.\n\nIn addition to Powell\u2019s comments on Monday, Fed representatives speaking this week include Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee.\n\nMarket watchers will be tracking expected earnings reports from Broadcom (AVGO), CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), and Five Below (FIVE).\n\n**Monday, June 2**\n\n* S&P final U.S. manufacturing PMI (May)\n* ISM manufacturing PMI (May)\n* Construction spending (April)\n* Fed speakers: Powell, Logan, Goolsbee\n* Earnings: Campbell\u2019s (CPB), Science Applications International (SAIC)\n\n**Tuesday, June 3**\n\n* Factory orders (April)\n* Job openings (April)\n* Fed speakers: Logan, Goolsbee\n* Earnings:\n   * CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)\n   * Ferguson Enterprises (FERG)\n   * Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)\n   * Dollar General (DG)\n   * Guidewire Software (GWRE)\n   * NIO (NIO)\n\n**Wednesday, June 4**\n\n* ADP employment (May)\n* S&P final U.S. services PMI (May)\n* ISM services PMI (May)\n* Federal Reserve Beige Book\n* Fed speaker: Bostic\n* Earnings:\n   * Dollar Tree (DLTR)\n   * Descartes Systems Group (DSGX)\n   * Five Below (FIVE)\n   * PVH Corp (PVH)\n   * Thor Industries (THO)\n\n**Thursday, June 5**\n\n* Initial jobless claims (Week ending May 31)\n* U.S. trade deficit (April)\n* U.S. productivity \u2013 first revision (Q1)\n* Fed speaker: Harker\n* Earnings:\n   * Broadcom (AVGO)\n   * Lululemon Athletica (LULU)\n   * Samsara (IOT)\n   * Rubrik (RBRK)\n\n**Friday, June 6**\n\n* U.S. employment report (May)\n* Consumer credit (April)\n\n**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  \nThe scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.\n\nTrump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in \u201cwait-and-see\u201d mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.\n\nEarlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.\n\nSeveral Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed\u2019s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.\n\nThe Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.\n\nInvestors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.\n\n**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  \nChipmaker Broadcom\u2019s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.\n\nLogistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.\n\nWith consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell\u2019s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.\n\nOther noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",

    "title": "The Sum of All Fears: Debt Crisis, Stagflation, High Rates, Tight Liquidity, Political Division, and Tech Valuation Pressures",
    "selftext": "Are you still optimistic? How much can the US stock market rise? In another 18 days, Tesla will reach $500. Will Nvidia break $300 in the third quarter?\n\nI often hear such questions, but whenever I discuss confirmed economic issues with them, I am always laughed at.\n\nWill the US economy always rise? If the time scale is extended, then it must be, because if we look at the US economy in units of 5 years, at most there is a plateau period in a short time axis, and then it rises.\n\nBut when we expand the time axis, we will see the peaks and troughs brought by the economic cycle.\n\nIn 2000, my Hong Kong boss said to me who had just joined the company, \"Now is the IT crisis, but it is also an opportunity. Don't worry, the economy is always like this, good four years, bad four years, very good four years, very bad four years\". When it is good, work hard to make money, when it is bad, enjoy life, study for a doctorate or have a child, or travel.\n\nHow many years has the United States not had an economic crisis? I think it has been 12 years since the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. The economy was bad for half a year during the pandemic, and then there was a crazy rebound. Everyone was shouting, great, great, great.\n\nBut is this normal? I think all investment bank researchers, except Goldman Sachs, are terrified. Including Powell, as the title says, there are liquidity problems, US debt problems, Japanese carry trade problems, uncertain political environment, and overpriced US stocks.\n\nMany people on Twitter Space are asking \"Why haven't you cut interest rates yet? What are you waiting for?\" When I started talking to them about the whole environment using macroeconomics and monetary principles. Most people said \"Are you a nerd?\" \"Why are you telling us these words from books? Don't you see that nothing exists?\"\n\nAnd real traders sent me private messages saying \"Don't make trouble, no one will believe you, pessimists are always right, optimists make money, you won't prevent us from making money, but you will make us feel sick.\"\n\nThis is the problem happening now.\n\nOr just like the post in the morning, imagine that if Tesla is found to not exist in the future and starts to trample, how much will the stock price be considered normal.\n\nRational researchers have already calculated it. $60-80 per share is reasonable. This still requires that Tesla's automotive business cannot slow down, and that businesses other than automotive must continue to expand within three years, such as points, Bitcoin, energy storage, and Robotaxi.\n\nIf this premise does not exist, it will be even more devastating.\n\nIf Tesla is trampled and the US stock market falls, it will cause panic flight of global assets, and a larger area of \u200b\u200btrampling will occur. If the Bank of Japan raises interest rates again, carry trades will withdraw money, which is the\n\n\"sum of fear\"\n\nWhy is there a liquidity crisis for the US dollar, and why Powell dares not cut interest rates casually when the US GDP continues to improve and the unemployment rate falls.\n\nThis is another problem facing the United States now. If interest rates are cut and money is withdrawn, the liquidity crisis will come early. The market is facing collapse. If interest rates are not raised, the whole world will eat high interest rates in the United States and be comfortable, and the money is also in the United States.\n\nBut does the United States just need to maintain high interest rates? It depends on whether the final BIG American BILL can be passed.\n\nAfter all, in Chinese terms, \"internal debt is not debt\" The Chinese government firmly believes in this truth, and they are crazy about printing money and issuing money to stimulate the economy. Because internal debt is not debt at all.\n\nIt\u2019s just that Chinese economists only said the first half of the sentence, and they always forgot to say the second half for various reasons\n\n\u201cDomestic debt is not a debt, as long as people are still there\u201d\n\n\n\nThe above content is derived by me based on macroeconomics. Macroeconomics usually has a huge time deviation from reporting to the occurrence of actual problems. For example, the forecast is next week, but it may be delayed by 10 years.\n\n\n\n# John Maynard Keyns \"In the long run, we are all dead\"",

They need to fix their charging infrastructure, but overall a solid car plus they got invested in my Volkswagen so they have plenty of cash to burn. \n\n2. Target - maybe not the Best Buy with the tariff situation but still undervalued imo. \n\n3. Nio - stock with lots of potential and extreme down fall. I'm not super confident in this one but $3 price and a growing EV market in China seems interesting. Would not sit in this one too long. Careful this Monday is earnings date. \n\n4. SNAP - I don't believe in the app but they got a lot of money and one interesting development or positive stock news means it will hit $10-15. This stock has been know to go up and down from $6-$15. Would sell at 20-30 percent increase.\n\n5.AMD - still undervalued, long on this one. ",

Many posts before this have been criticized for their poor English, so I used GPT to translate it into English, but the content is all written by me. I hope the administrator will not delete it.\n\n  \n*Thank you very much for pointing out the error in the article. The market value today is 1.09 trillion, which is about double the sum of the eight auto companies. If this is not a bubble, then what is a bubble?*\n\n**Once upon a bull market, Tesla wasn't just a car company. It was a religion. A meme. A movement. A narrative so powerful it defied gravity, valuation models, and even quarterly earnings. But now? It looks more like a slow-motion collapse wrapped in AI promises and tweet-sized miracles.**\n\nTesla's market cap\u2014still hovering near **$1.09 trillion**\u2014dwarfs the combined value of multiple legacy automakers that, together, sell tens of millions more vehicles annually. Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW, Stellantis, GM, Ford, Honda, Hyundai... all still trail behind. Tesla, meanwhile, **sells fewer cars**, has **no new models in sight**, and faces a **50% drop in European sales**.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving that valuation? Not cars. Not earnings. Not delivery growth. Just **narratives**.\n\n**Narrative #1: FSD will change the world.**  \nIt hasn\u2019t. Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving remains a **Level 2 driver assist system**\u2014miles away from full autonomy. Elon\u2019s promises of robotaxis \u201cnext year\u201d date back to 2016. Today, regulatory hurdles and technical stagnation have turned this dream into a meme.\n\n**Narrative #2: Tesla is an AI company.**  \nSure\u2014if you consider YouTube clips of \u201coptimus\u201d robots doing carefully choreographed tasks a viable roadmap. The humanoid robot narrative is pure sci-fi, built for headlines and hopium.\n\n**Narrative #3: Clean energy saviour.**  \nTesla earns billions not from products, but from **regulatory carbon credits**\u2014money that vanishes as competitors go electric. Even subsidies are drying up in markets like Germany and the U.S.\n\nSo what\u2019s left? **Bitcoin gains.** Elon\u2019s real alpha play may just be Doge-fueled attention arbitrage.\n\n**But here\u2019s the real danger:**  \nTesla isn\u2019t just a company\u2014it\u2019s become **too big to ignore**, and perhaps **too public to fail quietly**. Global pension funds, ESG portfolios, sovereign wealth managers, and speculative capital fueled by zero-interest rates are all in deep. Behind every retail trader shouting \u201cdiamond hands\u201d is a sleepy institutional allocator praying this doesn\u2019t blow up before retirement.\n\nIf Tesla collapses, it won\u2019t be Enron\u2014a cooked-book scandal.  \nIt won\u2019t be Lehman\u2014a financial black hole.  \nIt will be **both**:\n\n* The faith-based valuation of Enron\n* The systemic exposure of Lehman\n\nA bursting Tesla bubble could trigger **liquidity shocks**, **portfolio meltdowns**, and a **narrative crash** that destroys trust in market rationality.\n\n**Narrative capitalism brought us here.**  \nA reality show CEO.

We've made a pretty huge move up to $105.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\-Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, utilizing driverless Model Y vehicles. Elon Musk also confirmed he is leaving the government DOGE initiative and will focus on the company. This has been on a tear for the past month- that break from the $300 level was what I was most interested in, interested if we set up again for $375/$400. The launch of its robotaxi service is another way to signal that it's challenging Waymo, but whether it will succeed without LIDAR or not is another question. Regulation news/catalysts are the biggest potential movers of the robotaxis news.",

    "title": "Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as \u2018crisis\u2019 builds",
    "selftext": "Elon Musk\u00a0needs to spend more time at\u00a0Tesla\u00a0as his electric vehicle company faces a \u201ccrisis,\u201d according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company\u2019s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,\u201d the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company\u2019s board chair. \u201cMoreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk\u2019s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\u201d\n\nThe investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.\n\nEarly last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered\u00a0Tesla\u00a0to rescind Musk\u2019s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board\u2019s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.\n\nMusk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25%\u00a0voting control\u00a0of the company.\n\nTesla\u2019s\u00a0brand\u00a0value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to\u00a0Musk\u2019s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party ahead of the country\u2019s parliamentary election this year.\n\nAt DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.\n\nTesla once ranked eighth among the most popular American brands in the\u00a0Axios Harris Poll\u00a0of public perceptions of the 100 most visible U.S. companies.\u00a0But recently, Tesla dropped to 95th, behind six other automakers in that poll.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock price is down 12% this year, while the Nasdaq is down just 1%.\n\nData this week revealed that Tesla\u2019s\u00a0monthly sales\u00a0across Europe plunged by nearly half in April compared to the same time last year. That trend extends the steep declines Tesla saw in the\u00a0first quarter.\n\nThe investors who signed Wednesday\u2019s letter own about 7.9 million shares in the company combined. They blamed a Tesla board that\u2019s \u201cunwilling to act in the best interest of all Tesla shareholders\u201d by requiring Musk\u2019s \u201cfull-time attention\u201d on the company.\n\nMusk said this week that he plans to focus more on his businesses, which include xAI and SpaceX in addition to Tesla.\n\nThose who signed the letter included the pro-labor SOC Investment Group, American Federation of Teachers, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and\u00a0Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner.\n\nThe investors asked Tesla to add at least one new independent director with no personal ties to other board members. Tesla earlier this month\u00a0said\u00a0former\u00a0Chipotle\u00a0CFO Jack Hartung will join the company\u2019s board. Hartung previously worked with Musk\u2019s brother and Tesla board member Kimbal Musk, who was a board member at the Mexican food chain.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment in response to the letter.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/tesla-investors-demand-musk-work-40-hour-week-at-ev-maker-amid-crisis.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/tesla-investors-demand-musk-work-40-hour-week-at-ev-maker-amid-crisis.html)\n\nShareholder's letter: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d374de8aae9940001c8ed59/t/68373c455ee97f62782665cc/1748450373512/Tesla\\_Denholm+Letter\\_5\\_2025\\_Final.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d374de8aae9940001c8ed59/t/68373c455ee97f62782665cc/1748450373512/Tesla_Denholm+Letter_5_2025_Final.pdf)",

While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had\u00a0strong potential for growth.\n\nThursday\u2019s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it\u00a0grew server and networking sales by 37%\u00a0in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently\u00a0raised its price target\u00a0for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP\u2019s scheduled report on Wednesday.\n\nCostco Wholesale is on Thursday\u2019s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its\u00a0April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco\u00a0reported a 9% revenue growth\u00a0in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.\n\nAutoZone\u2019s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an\u00a0upgrade from Bank of America Securities\u00a0as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods\u2019 expected report on Wednesday follows its\u00a0recent deal to acquire\u00a0sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).\n\nInvestors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which\u00a0competes with Tesla\u00a0(TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.\n\nInflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus\n\nFriday\u2019s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases\u00a0cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is\u00a0closely watching prices\u00a0in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nWednesday\u2019s expected release of the minutes of the\u00a0May meeting of the FOMC\u00a0will provide more insight into Fed officials\u2019 deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.\n\nRevisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the\u00a0economy shrank\u00a0in the first three months of 2025.\n\nThe state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that\u00a0consumers\u2019 moods have soured\u00a0over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday\u2019s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy.\u00a0",

    "title": "Tesla: Vision, Volatility, and the Illusion of Invincibility",
    "selftext": "I have been lurking on r/stocks, WallStreetBets, etc., for a while, and I keep seeing two types of posts related to Tesla: \"Tesla is a meme stonk/it's being manipulated\" and \"This time it's going to the moon!\" As someone who has lost a significant amount of money shorting Tesla, I'd like to share my thoughts.\n\n**Stage 1: Inception**\n\n> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.\n\nTo understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'\u00e9tat to become CEO.\n\nTo Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.\n\nThis also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.\n\nThis is an admittedly gross oversimplification. There were many moments when Tesla was on the brink of bankruptcy and made smart decisions to survive (e.g., vertical integration, preorder deposits, charging station infrastructure, leveraging momentum for public subsidies, and utilizing new technologies for marketing). What's important is that Elon and Tesla equal a futuristic vision that captures the attention of idealists\u2014idealists with money and talent.\n\nThese idealists invested billions in Tesla's preorder capital, enabling them to build the necessary infrastructure for the product afterward. Despite obvious quality control issues and broken promises from Elon, they were passionate about their Teslas. They also invested heavily in Tesla, holding 40-50% of its shares, far beyond the average of the magnificent seven.\n\nThey invested in ideology, which enabled the stock to remain stable for years despite outlandish claims, missed goals, and ongoing challenges.\n\n**Stage 2: The Stock**\n\nTraders noticed. They found a stock with a financial model driven by subsidies, an idolized leader, and a rabid fan base (both in the product and among stock owners) who remained loyal despite poor fundamentals, negative news, and setbacks. The perfect options trading stock. The rabid fanbase subsidized downsides, and upsides were attributed to visionary leadership and positive signs for the green revolution.\n\nFor years, short sellers have highlighted the obvious risks and challenges facing Tesla, only to be proven wrong because Tesla doesn't follow the fundamental principles expected of a standard company. In late 2020, call volumes regularly hit 8\u201312 million contracts daily, fueling Tesla's massive rally into the S&P 500. This also created Tesla's second flywheel:\u00a0a loyal investment base that remained unflappable in the face of negative news and stood by the stock, which rewarded calls and punished puts, driving the stock prices higher creating a second\u00a0loyal investor - the long-put and long-invest investor who doesn't care about the green revolution - and further garnering Elon's reputational belief that he can only do good. Today, Tesla's short interest is relatively low\u2014only about 2.9% of the float (roughly 81 million shares short as of the latest report)\u2014because short sellers have been burned repeatedly by relying on fundamentals.\n\nTesla's stock hit 'god mode' at this point. Yes, they have had a million downturns, volatile peaks and valleys, etc. But their P/E ratio has 'sustainably' risen to over 200, putting it in the 'magnificent seven'. It also 'justifies' an incredibly high P/E ratio because consequences don't matter when the downside is muted compared to the long-term upside, at least from an investment perspective.\n\n**Elon's Fall From Grace**\n\nFast-forward to 2020. Tesla is on fire, but the world is hit with COVID. Whether you agree with what happened during COVID, Elon took a counter approach to his traditional fan base (and customer base) by refusing to shut down production and adopting masking. By 2022, he had acquired Twitter and began to suppress dissent, spread conspiracy theories, and exhibit erratic behavior publicly. This creates volatility in the stock, but it continues to defy the fundamentals because either they still believe in the green revolution (I like Tesla, not Elon) or they believe in the stock's investor loyalty fundamentals.\u00a0\n\n**Today**\n\nToday, Tesla is no longer the darling of disruptive innovation it once was. After over a decade of rapid growth, the company\u2019s fundamentals are under stress:\n\n* 2024 marked the first annual decline in deliveries in over a decade, falling 1.1% to 1.79 million vehicles. U.S. deliveries dipped slightly, and Tesla's growth slowed dramatically in China amid fierce competition.\n* Profit margins collapsed. The operating margin shrank from 16.8% in 2022 to 7.2% in 2024. In Q1 2025, it dropped to 2.1%, the lowest in years. Net income was just $0.4B for the quarter.\n* Tesla's average selling price fell to around $41,000, its lowest in at least four years, due to aggressive price cuts that failed to drive significant growth.\n* Competitors like BYD have created comparable products for superior prices, and traditional brands have caught up.\n* Tesla is not a leader in any particular category: they are not the most luxurious car company (Mercedes is); they are not the cheapest (BYD is); they are way behind competitors in self-driving.\n* Tesla's future vision will arguably degrade its fundamental position as a car company, leaving it competing in a low-margin arena against financial juggernauts like Google and BYD.\n* Early Q2 figures show a decimation in Europe and a ~20% fall in China's sales numbers compared to last year.\n* Republicans are threatening to remove the tax credits that historically made Tesla profitable. \n\nDespite this, the stock remains inflated, trading at 250 times 2025 estimated earnings, with a forward PEG over 13, pricing in a future that has yet to arrive.\n\nBut investor confidence is unraveling:\n\n* **Tesla insiders are fleeing:**\u00a0Kimbal Musk, Robyn Denholm, and James Murdoch collectively sold over $100M in stock in early 2025.\n* **Smart money is leaving Tesla:** Active institutional investors like Baillie Gifford and Soros Fund Management have pared down or exited. Index funds still hold large stakes, but these flows can reverse if passive inflows slow.\nOptions activity remains high, with speculative call volumes starting to create gamma-driven rallies. However, these spikes are increasingly divorced from Tesla\u2019s actual earnings performance, with Tesla short sellers losing ~$9 billion in recent months.\n\nThe Robotaxi Narrative Remains Speculative. Tesla has committed, via SEC filings, to launching a ride-hailing robotaxi service in 2025, anchored in \u201cunsupervised\u201d Full Self-Driving. But the current system remains Level 2 (driver-assist), not autonomous and WAY behind competitors who have obtained Level 4. Legal filings explicitly acknowledge that no Tesla vehicle can operate without human oversight.\n\n* U.S. federal regulators (NHTSA, DOJ, SEC) actively investigate Tesla\u2019s self-driving claims. A defect investigation opened in May 2025 could lead to fines or forced recalls if unsupervised operation proves unsafe.\n\n* California\u2019s DMV is prosecuting Tesla for deceptive advertising. Courts in Germany and China have already forced Tesla to scale back its autonomy claims.\n\n* Tesla\u2019s robotaxi pilot in Austin is permitted not because of federal approval, but because Texas law lacks regulation. Even here, city officials demanded safety disclosures ahead of launch.\n\n**Optimus: Faith-Based Valuation**\nThe Optimus humanoid robot remains entirely speculative. There are no commercial applications, no announced customers, and no revenue timeline. It functions as a narrative extension of Tesla\u2019s innovation brand but lacks any substantiated business case.\n\n**Conclusion: A Stock Built on Vision, Not Fundamentals.**\n\n Tesla's traditional stability base is cracking, and its advantage is eroding. Tesla\u2019s stock is not a reflection of its financial health, but of its mythos. The belief that Elon Musk can defy gravity\u2014again\u2014and unlock trillion-dollar markets in autonomy and robotics sustains its valuation.\n\nBut that belief is now contending with reality:\n\n* Declining sales and profits\n* Regulatory scrutiny\n* Insider divestment\n* Flattening growth\n* Intensifying competition (from BYD, GM, Ford, and others)\n\nShould the robotaxi program fail to launch as promised, or if another recall or crash undermines confidence in Full Self-Driving (FSD), Tesla\u2019s valuation could reset swiftly and violently. However, people are holding on to Tesla because it has consistently delivered results. But, unlike 2019\u20132021, there is no longer a vacuum of competition. Nor is there room to price in years of flawless execution without scrutiny.\n\nTesla may still surprise. Its liquidity is strong with over $37 billion in liquidity, and its Dojo AI infrastructure and energy business offer real, long-term potential. However, until speculative projects deliver verifiable results, the stock\u2019s current pricing reflects faith rather than fundamentals. And faith, when shaken, can fall faster than fundamentals ever rise.",

    "selftext": "The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor. He also hopes that investors will look to ten years later.\n\nAs an investor, it is very important to look forward to a better future, because this is the basic concept of investment. However, this does not mean that we only look at the future and not the fundamentals of a company, that is, the main business. Not to mention what if this so-called future is unreliable? This interview can confirm that Saudi investors are very dissatisfied with the sales of his cars, which is Musk's most hated topic. After all, he has said that he doesn't like the car business anymore, and he wants to make cooler Robotaxi, robots, and FSD. And these are all far away.\n\nI know that many Tesla fans have been insisting on proving to everyone how great FSD is. But you know, although many people have shown that FSD can travel 300KM, even across the east and west of the United States without human intervention once. But on the NHTSA registration list, it is L2 autonomous driving. I even wonder why NHTSA allows FSD to be approved without holding the steering wheel. After all, it is only L2 instead of L3 or L4. Of course, this is not important. What is important is that the foundation of FSD today is not enough to support Robotaxi.\n\nI have also met Tesla fans who told me, \"If FSD really doesn't work, at most we can add a lidar, which is not a difficult task.\" When I used the logic of business school to analyze it for them, when lidar is added, the competitors will become WAYMO, and WAYMO has been leading for 5 years in using lidar and getting L4, so Tesla will have to catch up.\n\nTesla fans said contemptuously, \"So what, does WAYMO have a rocket? Can it take us to Mars?\"\n\nIn the past, Musk could always say Next Year, but when Next Year has arrived, what should he do? Forever Mars plan?\n\n",

The success of the stock offering, which may increase to $5.3 billion if CATL exercises an option to do so, single-handedly doubled Hong Kong\u2019s proceeds from listings this year and could embolden other companies to go public. \n\nCATL is \u201ca true champion enabling the energy transition, a symbol of China\u2019s success as a global green leader,\u201d said Karine Hirn, a partner at East Capital Group. \n\nPriced at around 17 times current earnings multiples, CATL\u2019s Hong Kong shares have room to rise 50%, driven by strong earnings and attractive valuations, said Johnson Wan, head of China industrials research at Jefferies in Hong Kong. \n\nCATL supplies batteries to top-tier customers such as Tesla Inc., Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG. It has a market share of roughly 38% in electric-car batteries, comfortably ahead of its closest challenger, top EV maker BYD Co.\u2019s 17%, according to SNE Research.\n\nThe Ningde, Fujian-based company generated sales of $50 billion and net income of $7 billion last year. And it plans to build on that \u2014 recently unveiling batteries that can charge 520km (323 miles) of range in 5 minutes and up to 1,500km on a full charge. \n\nThe funding, much of it for a $7.6 billion overseas expansion in Europe, will be used to fuel its growth outside China, where profit margins are juicier.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-19/catl-set-to-debut-in-hong-kong-after-world-s-top-listing-in-2025",

    "selftext": "A lot of people have been stumped about why markets have not been making sense. Trump announced tarrifs will go down but tariffs still hurt the economy and somehow the market goes up. 1 country strikes a trade deal and market goes up. Tesla reported terrible earnings then stock goes up. Moody's downgrade of US rating, as well as the largest store in the USA says prices will increase because of tariffs and market finishes positive during the first trading day after the news. None of it makes sense. \n\nSmart investors are looking to make sense of a stock in order to determine a buy or a sell but literally everything seems unpredictable.. The resounding answer from the community seems to be \"the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" and all the other common phrases you hear here. But what if it is being rational? \n\nI've seen a lot of the blame placed on institutional investors trying to manipulate the market or they don't know what they're doing. \"There's a reason 86% of them don't beat the S&P.\" But what if we have been placing blame on the wrong group? \n\nYTD institutions have taken more money out or bet against the market significantly more than they have put in. AKA, if they controlled the stock market like they used to, the market would be nearly as predictable as we are used to. \n\nWhat I think is not being accounted for is the exponential increase in retail investors. YTD retail investors have pumped the market with loads of cash and optimism. Retail has put in significantly more positive cash than institutions have negative. \n\nMaybe we need to think less about how the market has reacted in the past or what institutions think. But take more of a balanced approach, taking into consideration retail investors.\n\nHowever I'm not sure from where we would draw this retail investment consideration? From what I see on social media people are afraid of prices going up, tariffs, keeping their jobs and affording life basics. Not extra money to invest, let alone enough to sway markets.. However, accessibility is easier than ever. Online sports betting is a billion dollar business, investing is just as easy. Should we now consider hopium is the new leading default for retail investors and that retail money is stronger than institutional? ",

    "selftext": "Now that the future has arrived,  Musk's lies are also being exposed one by one. Have you seen the latest news? On June 19, only a very small number of so-called Cybercabs will be used on the road, and only by invitation, but NHTSA still thinks this is wrong. Musk has not responded to NHTSA yet. What kind of autonomous driving will the so-called Cybercab be and how will it be regulated? Of course, Musk's good friends in the White House may directly ask NHTSA to give up all questions about Musk.\n\nMusk is unfortunate because all the liars have been exposed before him, and he has to face more stringent investor supervision. For example, the protagonist of \"Bad Blood\", a lady who doesn't blink, investors are fed up with boasting but not delivering, and Musk must deliver. But the problem is that once it is delivered, the lie will be exposed.\n\nWithout L4 autonomous driving and Robotaxi comparable to Waymo, everything about him is being sniped. Just like when Cybertruck was released, Tesla fans asked me, \"Look, the slap is so fast and strong, call us daddy. Musk is a god.\" Because in the previous year, I have been saying that Cybertruck has no market at all, this is a vertical segment. The main scene of Truck is work, not play. And they think that everything I, a dull ITIL consultant and a third-rate business school auditor, say is ridiculous. But after I shouted daddy to everyone in the chat room and accepted their humiliation. In less than a year, Cybertruck sales collapsed. I want to find them on Twitter and let them prove that I am not wrong. But they all said to me, \"Do facts matter? We made money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock market returns. Hold on to your truth and go back to Australia. Loser.\" Now the same is true for Cybercab. Musk made it, but no one will pay for it. He can't even catch up with \"WAYMO, the backward smart driving using lidar\". After all, Waymo is L4 autonomous driving, certified by NHTSA. And Musk is L2. It's ridiculous.\n\nThe European market has given up subsidies for BEVs. The BEV market has collapsed. Now it is the hybrid market, which is dominated by Toyota. I believe that the United States will continue to subsidize and use taxpayers' money to build charging stations one after another, which will continuously put money into Musk's pocket. Of course, there is also China. After all, the Chinese government has many \"good friends\" and \"influential people\" in the United States to help them lobby the White House. So enjoy all Tesla fans, the death knell has sounded.",

That would make Tesla\u2019s demonstration much less impressive then depicted.\"\n\n\\- \"Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas stated that Tesla said their Austin Robotaxi pilot will be \u201cInvite Only. Plenty of tele-ops to ensure safety levels \u2013 we can\u2019t screw up.\u201d \"\n\n\\- \"... It will be invite only...It is unknown if those who ride will need to do an NDA...\"\n\n\\- \"Some have speculated Musk is not telling the truth...\" (I had to add this one for laughs).\n\n\\- \"After promising that Robotaxis will be unsupervised, Tesla will probably state that they only meant that there will be no in-car supervision, so Tesla fans may not be disappointed. If there\u2019s lots of remote driving, however, that\u2019s a let-down because it\u2019s not self driving, and not a product that really scales.\"\n\nIn summary, avid Tesla fans and insiders will be able to get a remotely operated ride in Austin very soon. Basically, it's going to be 10 to 20 drone taxis with a driver sitting in the HQ. Most importantly, as the article says, Tesla fans will not be disappointed. I expect they will indeed go nuts.\n\nStock goes up no matter what.\n\nEdit: Fixed accidental bullet point. Reddit on my phone went FSD.",

    "title": "Root problem Employment Rate-- there is no market prospect for Tesla, Cyber\u200b\u200bCAB and all Robotaxi industry.Tesla's Second Death Knell",
    "selftext": "Many so-called \"business analysts\" and \"securities analysts\" compare Tesla's Robotaxi project CyberCAB with Uber when analyzing it, because in their perception, Uber has blown up the taxi industry, and Robotaxi will be like a warrior, blowing up Uber. But they are all wrong, because they don't understand the government's decision-making path at all. Of course, if the government is like an extreme capitalist and imperial government, such as China, then it is indeed possible. Otherwise, it is just fantasy. Because they ignore a fundamental problem, \"employment rate\".\n\nAlthough Uber has replaced a large part of the taxi market, it has compensated for a large number of driver jobs, which is why the government can default on Uber's development. Although it broke the licensed taxi industry, it can provide more jobs. If Robotaxi and CyberCAB are promoted on a large scale, the government will have to face a thorny problem, and the already vulnerable jobs will become even fewer.\n\nSo when we put aside all the technological and technical issues and look at it from the policy and technical aspects, we will find that the government will not encourage the driverless taxi industry in terms of policy. I know a lot of people will say \"shit, look at WAYMO, how well it has been running\". Right, but have you noticed that from 2019 to now, WAYMO has only expanded one city, and no more expansion, think about why. Apart from technical reasons, more expansion requires more permits, and who would want more unemployment within their own governance except for a few regions.\n\nI know that from the perspective of the Silicon Valley faction, the AI \u200b\u200bfaction, the Musk Mars faction, and the so-called decentralized cryptocurrency faction, this is the stupidest thing for the Earth government to artificially prevent the development of technology for the so-called \"employment rate\".\n\nThis is actually the fundamental problem, that is, the difference between the government and the enterprise. For enterprises, layoffs only need to lose money, security can be outsourced, non-essential expenses can be cut, and even employees can bring their own toilet paper to the office. But for the government, it is a completely different consideration, because it also involves the government's responsibilities and obligations to the people. Of course, if it is an extreme country like China, it can be considered less, yes, less, but it still has to be considered, pretending to be a civilized country.\n\nSo even if the United States, a country that does not have protection for pregnant women at the national level, still has to consider employment issues. Based on this, the so-called Robotaxi can only be a small-scale experiment.\n\nJust like unmanned supermarkets, Amazon in the United States has created unmanned supermarkets, which are very popular in China, but in countries like Japan, which have the most serious aging population and need to free up young labor, they are not interested in unmanned supermarkets at all. The reason why China is so interested is that it can cheat money in the capital market. After 2016, you only need to tell investors \"I have an IDEA for an unmanned supermarket.\" You can get millions of investments without even a slide or a business plan. Is anyone still talking about unmanned supermarkets now?\n\n  \nUnlike Waymo, Tesla must rely on the CyberCAB project to save its precarious car sales. Waymo does not have this burden, so it can be said that it is just for fun. No one really expects it to make money or be widely used.\n\n  \nTesla's death knell is ringing",

    "selftext": "In a regulatory filing out Friday, Elon Musk-led automaker Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders ability to sue the company if investors believe the company\u2019s board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties.\n\nThe filing says the new bylaw went into effect as of May 15, and that Tesla has adopted \u201can ownership threshold requiring any shareholder or group of shareholders to hold shares of common stock sufficient to meet an ownership threshold of at least 3% of Tesla\u2019s issued and outstanding shares in order to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s current market cap stands over $1 trillion. A 3% stake of common stock and all outstanding shares would be worth more than 30 billion dollars.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change to its bylaws.\n\nAccording to Ann Lipton, an experienced corporate and securities law trial attorney who now teaches at Tulane Law School, the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. The law permits companies that are incorporated in Texas, as Tesla is currently, to require a shareholder to own 3% before bringing a claim. \n\n\u201cObviously, for a company of Tesla\u2019s size, that would be a formidable barrier to anyone bringing a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nBy comparison, when Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, a shareholder who held just nine shares of Tesla stock was the plaintiff in a shareholder derivative suit that resulted in a judge ordering CEO Elon Musk\u2019s 2018 CEO compensation package to be rescinded, Lipton noted.\n\nDelaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla\u2019s board, had controlled the company and that the board\u2019s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking a vote to approve that pay plan. They also failed to negotiate with Musk over the terms of the deal, instead working \u201calongside him, almost as an advisory body,\u201d the judge ruled.\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who brought the suit, prompted Musk to say, \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d Tesla moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after attaining shareholders\u2019 approval to do so after that loss in court.\n\nTesla has since appealed the Tornetta decision and Delaware\u2019s state supreme court will decide if Musk can keep the shares granted to him through the 2018 CEO pay plan or not. That pay plan had been worth around $56 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/tesla-limits-investors-ability-to-sue-over-breach-of-fiduciary-duties.html",

    "title": "Why Tesla is another Enron - How can a company with a valuation equal to the world's seven largest automakers Earnings Catch-up",
    "selftext": "So why do I say that Tesla will be Enron? This involves a financial problem. Tesla's current valuation is equal to the sum of the world's seven automakers. But it sells fewer cars each year than any other brand. According to financial and financial laws, Tesla will eventually face \"Earnings Catch-up\", especially when the market starts to get worse (tips: Europe has officially canceled electric vehicle subsidies in 2024), and Tesla's sales have plummeted. Assuming that the Democrats will slash electric vehicle subsidies if they enter the White House again in four years, this is a set plan. Then Tesla needs Earnings Catch-up. By then, Tesla's main business will either be Robotaxi or sell 3 million to 5 million Tesla cars a year. Is this possible?\n\nIn my career as a professional manager, a very important part is to help companies implement ITIL strategies as an IT consultant, or to meet the IT audit needs of companies going public. In order to let IT geniuses understand what auditing is, we usually start with Enron and the US 404 Act.\n\nMy teacher has been explaining the Enron incident very seriously, and I have also studied the Enron incident since then. Of course, the United States, where the accident originated, has done more research and papers on Enron, and even made a movie called \"Enron-The Smartest Guys in the Room\".\n\nTherefore, this monster with a market value of trillions of dollars is just like Enron in the past. Beliefs and slogans are like the horn of the technological paradise, gathering a large number of irrational investors.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of pure finance and financial market technical theory, the financial pressure that Tesla needs to fulfill in 2026 is so great that it is suffocating, or even desperate. There have been many investors who scolded me while listening to my analysis. This is because they do not understand technology and only know how to buy and sell. In the past few years, they only read the parts of investment research reports that they like to read. They regard the risk part as a joke.\n\nThis involves a core issue. Musk said \"he doesn't care about making cars anymore\", which is good, and it can get rid of the problem of \"car manufacturer pricing\". But it faces the second problem of \"how to price Tesla\". Robotaxi? From an objective technical point of view, it is unknown when Tesla's Robotaxi will catch up with Waymo. After all, Waymo completed L4 autonomous driving as early as 2019, while FSD is still L2 to this day. Many people don't know that it is actually L2, not even L3.\n\nBipedal robots? From the perspective of the academic community in Australia and Europe, that is a joke. Not to mention Japan, a robot powerhouse, where even FANUC is not so optimistic.\n\nMore carbon credits? Yes, but the scale of growth will be limited unless the White House gives more taxpayer money.\n\n\n\nSpeculating on Bitcoin, using data centers to mine Bitcoin? It's not impossible, after all, are they scammers?\n\n\nHumankind has not made any breakthroughs in basic science since the 1980s. Europe has been working hard to make breakthroughs in basic science, so they spent a huge amount of time to build colliders, while the United States has invested billions of dollars in mining and AI. This is the problem the United States faces today.\n\nThis article would be worth $50,000 if I were giving a talk, so I won\u2019t go into too much detail, just to add to the urge to pee when I wake up late at night in Australia.\n",

The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into \"questionable diagnoses\" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal. Other stocks such as HUM/CVS/CI have moved on this as well.\n\n[**ETOR (eToro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ETOR&p=d) \\- eToro's IPO priced at \\~$68 per share, above the expected range of $46\u2013$50, and the stock bounced off \\~$65 off some strong bids. Mainly interested to see if the strong bids at $65 still exist (unlikely but I'll just keep an eye out anyway). Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term. Probably will just trade as a proxy to the C-market in the future and I don't like the structure of their contract for diffs.\n\n[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) \\- Alibaba reported Q4 revenue of 236.45B yuan, a 7% increase year-over-year, but slightly below analyst expectations of 237.91B yuan. Income from operations nearly doubled to 28.47B yuan driven by improved efficiency and reduced share-based compensation. This has been on a decent run since April 8th (peak fear tariff selloffs). Watching $125 level. Alibaba's cloud division saw an 18% revenue increase, with AI-related product sales posting triple-digit growth.\n\n[**FL (Foot Locker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FL&p=d) \\- Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) confirmed a $2.4B acquisition of Foot Locker at $24 per share, nearly double Foot Locker's previous closing price. Currently long and interested in seeing if we can converge even closer to $24, but overall don't see any other trade in this except for a reversal of news. Mainly integration challenges and potential antitrust concerns are the big risk, but unlikely with current admin.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \\- Tesla's stock has risen from $275 to $350 over the past six days but failed to break the $350 level twice. Currently short pretty close to $350, but will bail if we break $350 (probably a lower price level like $345). TSLA has mainly been on a tear (attributed to Musk stepping away from DOGE and returning to TSLA), and the news of Tesla board exploring a new pay deal for the CEO dropped yesterday. Mainly a short play based on how parabolic the stock has been, but will bail as needed.",

I had a serious discussion with many Tesla fans on Twitter Space in 2023. They think I am a stupid European old continent style professional manager. What public nature, what small and medium shareholders' interests. The great Musk leads Tesla to one milestone after another, which is a victory. Selling so many Tesla cars is a victory, and launching rockets again and again is a victory, why not pay salaries. A person with only a few hundred shares actually sued a key figure who made the United States great, and it was approved. This is a joke.\n\nI mentioned the CEO PAY RATIO and the responsibility and morality of enterprises to society, which attracted more Tesla fans, including typical investors on Reddit who think that there is no European old continent in the United States, including the stupid morality of the old world like Australia, which is a joke. In the United States, only whoever makes money is the most powerful. No need to reason, just show the holdings, full of social Darwinism theory, if you believe in Tesla, buy CALL, if you don't believe, buy PUT, why discuss science, why discuss technology and implementation routes, no need, these are all jokes. And there is no scientific spirit, just shout orders.\n\nBut in fact, when I think back to 2017, when I was attending an MBA course at a very small school in Australia, the teacher talked about the concept of CEO Pay Ratio, saying that American companies are as high as 300:1. That is, the gap between grassroots employees and CEOs is 300 times. And the UK, a bad country in Europe, is only 70-100 times. I knew that this salary would not satisfy Musk. Because if Musk's salary is really approved, it will bring the US Pay Ratio to an incredible level. The United States has completely lost any morality.\n\nAlthough the United States is indeed a country where everything is about money and whoever has money is the king, I also see that the strong Delaware judges are trying to maintain the final decency of the judiciary to give social fairness.\n\nCompared to the SEC, which weakly sued Musk and was even broken by Musk, the Delaware judge is the last and best shield of the United States.\n\nThe SEC is a regulatory unit that lacks even the most basic dignity and is far weaker than China's Securities Regulatory Commission.",

    "selftext": "BIG QUESTION ready for discussion - as there is so much momentum behind TESLA and Musk' statements around the Robotaxi and FSD.\n\nWaymo seems to be far ahead of Tesla and has 1.500 cars on the streets in 4 big US cities, while Musk talks about 10-20 cars to be placed in June/July in Austin.\n\nWaymo now reached 250k rides per week, a steep incline from 150k in Oct 2024 and 50k in May 2024.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/05/05/inside-the-waymo-factory-building-a-robotaxi-future/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/05/05/inside-the-waymo-factory-building-a-robotaxi-future/)\n\n\u201cIn fact, these vehicles can pick up their first public passengers less than 30 minutes after leaving the factory,\u201d Waymo said in its blog post. The company said that vehicles intended for other cities can be deployed into public service in a matter of hours after being shipped to their local depot.\n\nBesides, questions remains on \"camera only\"-concept of Tesla competing with camera/LIDAR/radar of others. Others deem camera only concept to be unsafe in conditions like rain and fog. Telsa is rumoured to have hit a dead end road with this concept.\n\nJohn Krafcik, former Waymo CEO, clapped back, telling Business Insider, \"Tesla has never competed with Waymo \u2014 they've never sold a robotaxi ride to a public rider, but they've sold a lot of cars.\" His email continued, \"And although Tesla hopes to compete with Waymo someday, they've failed utterly and completely at this for each of the 10 years they've been talking about it.\"\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n",

    "title": "Purely rational: Tesla robotaxi without L4 isn\u2019t even a Challenger \u2014 Magic Quadrant shows how far it is from Waymo\u2019s leadership",
    "selftext": "\n\n||\n||\n|**Leaders**|WAYMO|\n|**Challengers**|Cruise|\n|**Visionaries**|Zoox,AutoX|\n|**Niche Players**|Tesla Robotaxi\uff0cPony.ai|\n\n\n\nIn our business analysis, there is a method called Gartner Magic Quadrants. If a normal analyst puts Tesla's CyberCAB product in this analysis method, he will only have one position, that is, NichePlayers, and even this is overestimating Tesla. After all, Waymo officially has L4 level autonomous driving, while Tesla's FSD is only L2 (in case you haven't heard, Tesla's FSD is only L2, not even L3).\n\n\n\nWaymo is obviously in the leader quadrant. It has launched fully autonomous Robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco. It has been successfully running for six years since 2019, although there have been many funny accidents during this period. But Waymo at least dares to claim that it has L4, not L3, or L3 plus, or like FSD, which is obviously L2 but induces the driver to let go. (By the way, L2 allows the driver to take both hands off the steering wheel, and only the United States can do this in the world).\n\nSo Tesla doesn't even have L4 autonomous driving, so what can it use to compete with Waymo, which dares to apply for L4 and uses lidar technology that is ridiculed by Tesla fans. L2 means that the responsibility is put on the driver, but L4 requires Waymo to pay for every accident with real money.\n\nAs of 15/May/2025 (sorry, we are used to typing dates like this in Australia). Tesla has not submitted an application for L4 autonomous driving, so I would like to ask Tesla fans. What will they use to make Cybercab on June 19? Of course, Musk's good friend, a gentleman in the White House, may be able to slam the table and roar angrily, demanding that NHTSA officials unconditionally let his best political allies and election campaigners start Robotaxi business immediately.\n\n\n\nFrom my perspective, the US stock market really feels like the Nasdaq bubble in 2000. It is full of lies and incompetence at the regulatory level. The entire market is either VR, AR or AI, quantum chips (here again, quantum algorithms do not solve the problem of general computing. Before 2022, there were many research projects in the United States to study how to accelerate quantum computing for general computing, and they all failed), autonomous driving, and cryptocurrency. Remove MAG7, where is the value of the United States?\n\nIn my opinion, Europe is better than the United States. The European academic community does not brag about AI, but focuses on researching colliders.\n\nI once asked a friend from NASA, \"Why don't you launch more deep space satellites to explore the universe?\" Their answer was \"Space science is not like Silicon Valley, where you can just blow bubbles. Space research requires a lot of objective conditions, and these objective conditions are calculated based on decades or even hundreds of years, such as planets connecting in a straight line. This kind of opportunity requires a long wait, and before the astronomical conditions are met, there is very little that humans can do).\n\nI will write about the current AI scams when I have time, which is also a purely rational analysis.\n\nFinally, I want to thank the administrators here. I have been banned in several forums for telling the truth.",

    "selftext": "I am a long-term Chinese investor. I have been firmly bearish on Tesla for four years and have been laughed at by other investors for four years. But I am firm in my opinion because I am different from other investors. I have two undergraduate degrees in IT and economics, and I am also a mechanical enthusiast in my spare time. I understand mechanics, economics and IT better than others. I believe that the release date of Cybercab will be another Enron and Tesla's doomsday. How can it be achieved unless his good friend, the president, helps.\n\nAll the achievements of BEV today are based on government subsidies. In 2024, after the European government cancelled the BEV subsidies, the sales of hybrid and Toyota immediately increased. So when countries around the world gradually canceled the subsidies for electric vehicles in the next few years, who will buy them? Of course, the president's friends can ask the federal government to buy them at the government level.\n\nToday, Tesla's market value is higher than Toyota, GM and Honda. This is really a joke.\n\nMany people also told me that \"Tesla is not just a car company, it is the future, Mars, artificial intelligence, and innate intelligence. It will replace all humans.\"\n\nI don't want to discuss this topic with people who have no science and engineering background anymore. Really, there is a saying in China that \"if you don't cheat a fool's money, it's a waste.\" These people are the same.\n\nSometimes I really feel strange about the US stock market. The SEC is like a thing that bullies the weak and clings to the powerful. On the contrary, even the China Banking Regulatory Commission, which is called the \"fraud market\", has always been a heavy-handed strike in regulating companies. It's just that it must cooperate with the Chinese government to control stock prices and the stock market, but it has never been afraid of any company. And the SEC is too weak.",

    "title": "Tesla Institutional Investor Movement- Mixed Bag- Mostly Positive",
    "selftext": "I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the \"smart money\" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the \"smart money\" is doing, it doesn't look good for the bears.\n\nFrom the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%. Additionally, the total number of institutional holders increased 1.75%, from 4020 to 4091. Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions. Most firms that were both opening new positions and closing positions were relatively small in terms of total shares bought/sold with the exception of Nuveen, which opened a huge new position (listed below).\n\nI don't have access to the raw data but here are some notable moves from the 3/31/25 (submitted/visible 45-days after) reporting date of the larger firms that have substantial holdings of Tesla that are at least in the billions.\n\n**Buyers (shares/% increase in overall position):**\n\n|Institution|Shares Added|Percent Increase in Position|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Vanguard|3,694,524|1.519%|\n|Blackrock|3,482,055|1.722%|\n|Geode Capital Management|2,487,085|4.076%|\n|JPM\\*|3,426,144|9.52%|\n|Goldman Sachs|14,670,839|123.081%|\n|Charles Schwab|849,091|4.901%|\n|Invesco|2,211,300|17.585%|\n|Nuveen|12,531,327|new|\n|Citigroup|3,611,937|47.184%|\n|Deutsche Bank|1,733,531|20.778%|\n|Assenagon Asset Management|2,978,026|54.277%|\n|Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group|456,356|5.793%|\n|Swiss National Bank|26,100|0.321%|\n|Hsbc Holdings|19,426|0.242%|\n|National Bank Of Canada\\*|5,566,098|307.721%|\n|Franklin Resources|860|0.013%|\n|National Pension Service|172,845|3.345%|\n|Mitsubishi Ufj Asset Management|578,266|12.34%|\n|Rhumbline Advisers|20,295|0.39%|\n|Dimensional Fund Advisors|119,500|2.577%|\n|Wells Fargo|1,176,846|35.262%|\n|Aberdeen Group|1,729,053|65.228%|\n\n*\\*JPM analyst has one of the lowest price targets on Tesla and Canada was supposed to be \"mad\" at America. Ha! Not so much obviously...*\n\n**Sellers (shares/% decrease in overall position):**\n\n|Institution|Shares Sold|Percent Decrease In Position|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Capital World Investors|(954,950)|\\-2.317%|\n|Fmr LLC|(4,448,041)|\\-12.883%|\n|Northern Trust Corp|(992,003)|\\-3.471%|\n|Bank Of New York Mellon|(418,764)|\\-2.46%|\n|Wellington Management Group|(1,285,882)|\\-12.639%|\n|Jennison Associates|(994,502)|\\-10.239%|\n|Capital Research Global Investors|(755,524)|\\-9.637%|\n|Primecap Management|(473,525)|\\-6.267%|\n|American Century Companies|(157,691)|\\-2.183%|\n|Bank Of Montreal|(50,142)|\\-0.729%|\n|Ubs Group Ag|(757,244)|\\-10.429%|\n|California Public Employees Retirement System\\*|(60,314)|\\-1.265%|\n|Principal Financial Group Inc|(165,095)|\\-4.362%|\n|New York State Common Retirement Fund\\*|(112,326)|\\-3.195%|\n|Ark Investment Management|(28,594)|\\-0.87%|\n\n*\\*I assume these sales are politically motivated to some extent.*\n\nAgain, trying to be objective here, it clearly looks like moves to the upside are being made by more prominent name firms and in more dramatic fashion. There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \\~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).\n\nMy takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms. Net flows in are larger than net flows out. Don't shoot the messenger- But the indicator is bullish. And the recent stock trend reflects it.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Deepseek Races After Chatgpt As China's AI Industry Soars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-13/deepseek-races-after-chatgpt-as-china-s-ai-industry-soars)\n\n[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -> $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. \n\n[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.\n\n[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.\n\n**IPOs today:** [**ETOR**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kmetv6/the_etoro_ipo_boom_or_doom/) (DD is linked here)",

I noticed the company kept the strategy of innovating to social media that was more modern like reels, and their profitable business is the ads business which was very much intact. Fucking meta reversed to 2017 price levels...\n\n I ended these trades with +300% & +400% which was a first time.\n\nThen it came palantir another bullied stock by reddit, \"don't understand palantir it's just AI hype vapourware\" etc etc... Bought it at 16$ seemed the stock was coming back to life after that massive drop. Researched as much as I could to understand this company to see if redditors were right about it. They weren't.\n\n||\n||\n|Price|Quant|Appreciation|\n|18,2298|118|549,81 %|\n|16,4363|197|620,72 %|\n|16,4900|230|618,37 %|\n|24,4550|346|384,40 %|\n|21,9151|45|440,54 %|\n|19,9032|936|495,18 %|\n\nMy final remarks, I'm done day trading, I find it more usefull to spend days researching a good company that is building great stuff or just wait for dips like these to reshuffle my portfolio.\n\nPatience beats the market for sure, but if you want to weather storms like these at least pick good picks, and I'm not saying just companies that are already 1T marketcap, there's good companies emerging that also fit this and you can profit a lot.\n\n**Looking back I laugh at the stock picks & strategies I did, and I'm glad I'm done with that.

They have to spend lots of money on advertising to attract customers due to competition such as Ro. Customer acquisition costs is high but customer switching costs is minimal. There are probably dozens of other telehealth provider competing for the same product offerings. They sell generic drugs that a thousand other pharmacies make. Overall it's very similar to Netflix which takes other peoples products and places them in a glamorous digital online platform. They do not make drugs \ud83d\udc8a and thus have no competitive advantage from patents or IP. \n\n\n\nTheir compounded glp business is controversial and rightfully so given that they are profiting off billions of dollars spent for R&D from Lilly and Novo. It is a recipe for litigation. The only reason Novo partnered with Hims is due to most of the margins going to them (I assume so, otherwise it makes no sense). The only way I see HIMS becoming successful is actually delivering perfect, frictionless services as smooth as Amazon prime. But then again, who says other companies including Novo and Lly do not replicate this model and sell their newest GLP-1s exclusively through this platform, thus shrinking margins further from HIMs. Can anyone point to whether the recent rally is justified and if it is worth 50 billion in market cap?

    "title": "Palantir now among 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies \u2014 its earnings multiple is astronomical",
    "selftext": "There\u2019s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.\n\nData analytics software vendor\u00a0Palantir\u00a0jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of\u00a0Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants\u00a0Cisco\u00a0and\u00a0IBM\u00a0earlier this year.\n\nMicrosoft\u00a0tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by\u00a0Apple\u00a0and\u00a0Nvidia.\n\nPalantir\u2019s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.\n\nThe Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.\n\nPalantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company\u2019s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has\u00a0benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build\u00a0artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.\n\nIn an aminated\u00a0shareholder letter\u00a0attached to the company\u2019s earnings report, Karp applauded his company\u2019s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have \u201cturned a corner and begun following our lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm\u2019s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,\u201d Karp wrote.\n\nBut investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it\u2019s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit.\u00a0Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.\n\nThat all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.\n\n\u201cFundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,\u201d wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.\n\nAmong the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it\u2019s only that high because\u00a0Broadcom\u00a0and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla\u2019s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.\n\nPalantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following\u00a0first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a\u00a0deceleration in international commercial sales\u00a0that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy our shares,\u201d Karp told CNBC\u2019s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re happy. We\u2019re going to partner with the world\u2019s best people and we\u2019re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don\u2019t have to be.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/palantir-joins-top-10-most-valuable-tech-companies-stock-at-premium.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/palantir-joins-top-10-most-valuable-tech-companies-stock-at-premium.html)",

While smartphones, computers, memory chips and several other categories of products are currently spared from tariffs, some exemptions could be reversed in coming weeks as part of an investigation into semiconductors.\n> \n> \u201cImposing tariffs and blocking things, I think it\u2019s moving backward,\u201d Suss MicroTec Chief Executive Burkhardt Frick said in an interview.\n> \n> President Trump in April slapped tariffs on dozens of nations, then relented with a 90-day suspension for most countries following market turmoil, allowing leaders to reach out for trade deals. However, Washington excluded Beijing from the 90-day pause and imposed tariffs amounting to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with duties on U.S. imports of 125%.\n> \n> \u201cEven this 90-day pause is just buying time, while the two big elephants in the room are still provoking each other,\u201d Frick said. \u201cI think nobody will benefit. It\u2019s a zero-sum game.\u201d\n> \n> An industry veteran with more than 30 years\u2019 experience, Frick spent around two decades working in Philips\u2019 mobile display and semiconductor business before joining Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker ASML Holding in 2014 as vice president of strategic sourcing and supply chain. He took the reins of Suss MicroTec in 2023.\n\n---\n\n> Now, the company is getting a broader mix in what Frick called a helpful development because if one area loses some momentum, the company still has other product groups to sustain growth.\n> \n> \u201cOf course, a global recession would help nobody, and that\u2019s what everybody is concerned about,\u201d he said.\n> \n> While appetite for semiconductors to power the data centers and servers behind the AI boom continues to thrive, the industry has been agonizing for more than a year over weak demand for legacy chips found in cars and industrial machinery.\n> \n> Some chip makers, like Tesla supplier STMicroelectronics, are signaling that a recovery might be on the way, but tariffs or export controls could jeopardize the complex supply chains that the industry has relied upon for decades and potentially raising prices for consumers, Frick said.\n> \n> \u201cWould you pay $3,000 or more for an iPhone? Because that will be the result and that\u2019s just one gadget and this will go across the industry,\u201d Frick said. \u201cThat will really trigger a global recession and I think nobody wants that.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIt seems like the market has collective amnesia about the upcoming semiconductor tariffs. How should we play this? I imagine the currently excluded product categories will be swept up under this new separate tariff regime, such as smartphones. \n\nDo we expect this to stack on top of other tariffs for categories that didn't receive exclusions from the retaliatory tariffs?\n\nI'm holding a pretty significant amount of NVDA and other chip designers that rely on TSMC for fabrication",

    "title": "Short Seller Jim Chanos Rips On Tesla's Robotaxi",
    "selftext": "Prominent short seller Jim Chanos challenges the viability of Tesla's Robotaxi/Cybercab efforts.\n\nSource: [Short Seller Jim Chanos Slams Tesla Robotaxi Economics As 'Ridiculous,' Citing Dead Miles, Insurance Costs And Cleaning Expenses](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-jim-chanos-slams-234908579.html)\n\nThis should come as no surprise to anyone, including Elon. Tesla's own internal report showed that it would like lose money and be hard to scale outside of the US market.\n\nSource: [Elon Musk shut down internal Tesla analysis that showed Robotaxi would lose money](https://electrek.co/2025/04/16/elon-musk-shut-down-internal-tesla-analysis-that-showed-robotaxi-would-lose-money/)\n\nWhat is omitted from all this is any mention of potential brand damage affecting these future ambitions of Tesla. If people aren't willing to buy their cars, why would they ride in their Robotaxis? The market for this tech is major cities. I don't need to show anyone a map to display that most cities in America are left-leaning. And everything \"Tesla\" is conspicuously Tesla. Consumers have lots of choices in getting a ride these days. Why would they pick a Cybercab over an Uber or Lyft? \n\nLastly, Elon is terrible at math. I don't care if he is talking about saving \"trillions\" of dollars with government cuts or producing \"millions\" of Cybercabs. He is always off by orders of magnitude. I highly question his education. If he indeed earned a physics degree, he would at least be able to make projections based on reality within an order of magnitude. And he is nothing close to an engineer (I am one). His long running statement of making \"millions\" of Cybercabs is not based in reality. \n\nElon's latest quote: \"*I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year...*\"\n\nSource: [Tesla doubles down on robotaxi timeline; investors enthused - and skeptical](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-doubles-down-robotaxi-timeline-investors-enthused-skeptical-2025-04-24/)\n\nUber, Lyft, and traditional taxis all combined have somewhere over 2 million active drivers in the US. To reach anything in the \"millions\", Tesla would have to capture almost the entire market share of all ride hailing services upon launch of their long delayed combined product and service. That is pure nonsense being put out into the Elon Reality Distortion Field (ERDF). Tesla would in fact lose money by making more Cybercabs than the market could possibly demand. The same concept would apply if they made a trillion cars without any buyers for them. Don't people even check the actual market potential for any of his over-inflated promises?   \n\nTesla's current \"testing\" for their Robotaxi service is just their employees riding around in their cars. It's a PR stunt more than anything else. Meanwhile, Google's Waymo is providing actual rides to actual customer in multiple cities. Elon has criticized the Waymo's design and cost, yet his Robotaxi is nowhere to be seen on the roads. He also levels this public criticism when he needs to replace something like \\~4 million computers in preexisting Tesla's just to get them to meet previously promised FSD capabilities (there goes a few hundred million at least). He gets more traction for talking trash about his competitors when his own company is way behind and has nothing to show other than puffery and recalls. \n\nHow long will it take for the markets to escape the ERDF and realize that Elon is the boy that cried \"wolf\" (of Wall Street) one too many times to keep his stock price inflated?",

    "selftext": "I say Tesla (TSLA) has an upside of 1000% over the next 5-10 years. First Musk will perfect his robots in Tesla plants, and then he will replace the vast majority of Tesla auto factory workers with robots. Tesla's EV's will be the hands-down cheapest and best American electric vehicles, due to greatly reduced labor costs. Maybe Tesla cars won't sell well for a while, you say, because \"everyone hates Musk\". That's ok, with whatever Tesla vehicles don't sell, Musk will simply deploy them all as massive fleets of electric self-driving robotaxis that start undercutting Uber and Lyft all over America. There will soon be an energy crisis due to mass proliferation of AI GPU's, and electric vehicles. The fastest easiest solution to increase energy production incrementally is guess what...? SOLAR.  So then Tesla will make a killing by selling its state-of-the-art solar panels, and Chinese solar panels won't be able to compete in America, thanks to Trump tariffs. If skyrocketing silver prices becomes an issue, Musk will simply buy some silver mines like he said he might. Meantime, the Big-3 American Auto makers will be forced to replace their workforce with robots from Tesla, in order to lower their vehicle prices to compete with the cheaper and superior Tesla autos. Or maybe the Big-3 won't abandon UAW, and they'll all sink together. Either way Tesla wins. Musk will make sure worker robots are sold gradually in a strategic fashion, determining the Winners \\[those who are allowed to purchase worker robots first, before competitors are allowed\\] and Losers \\[those who aren't allowed (or don't want to) purchase robots, and are forced to stick with American human labor\\].",

    "selftext": "Tesla was once the pinnacle of innovation and cool. It disrupted the auto industry, made EVs aspirational, and built a cult following. But in recent years, Elon Musk\u2019s increasingly vocal and polarizing political involvementparticularly his alignment with far-right ideologies, controversial tweets, and platforming of misinformation has created serious reputational risk. I\u2019m not sure the Tesla brand will ever truly recover.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think Tesla is facing long-term brand damage:\n\t\u2022\tBrand and founder have become inseparable: Elon is Tesla. From product reveals to quarterly calls, he\u2019s been the face of the company. But now that he\u2019s aligned himself with hyper-partisan political causes, Tesla\u2019s once-universal appeal is eroding. You can\u2019t separate the product from the person, especially when that person is using his platform to make incendiary political statements.\n\t\u2022\tHe\u2019s alienated core markets: A significant portion of early Tesla adopters were environmentally-conscious, liberal-leaning consumers in coastal cities. These are the same people Musk now routinely antagonizes on X (formerly Twitter), a platform he owns and uses as a political megaphone. Many now say they\u2019d never buy a Tesla again, regardless of the car\u2019s quality.\n\t\u2022\tCompetitors have caught up: Tesla used to be the only game in town for stylish EVs. But now, legacy automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and BMW are producing high-performing electric vehicles that don\u2019t come with a politically toxic CEO attached. With competition heating up, brand reputation will matter even more.\n\t\u2022\tDeclining sentiment is measurable: Surveys from Morning Consult and YouGov show a sharp decline in Tesla\u2019s favorability, especially among Democrats and younger consumers. Stock analysts are even factoring in Musk\u2019s political behavior as a material risk in valuation models.\n\t\u2022\tThe Twitter/X debacle: Musk\u2019s management of Twitter (layoffs, policy changes, platforming extremists) has drawn widespread criticism. His behavior there is bleeding into how people view his other ventures, including Tesla. For many, buying a Tesla feels like endorsing his ideology",

This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.\n\n[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected.

Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well.

But all that nonsense aside, slamming foreign manufacturers with tariffs was supposed to provide a unique advantage for his new BFF Elon and Tesla. The stock rose after the tariffs were announced given their domestic operations. Now, it seems that the playing field has been leveled yet again. Or at least until tomorrow, or the next day, and who knows after that. Am I missing something here, or is this not bad news for Tesla with their rapidly rising competition? \n\nMaybe it's because my short position has been getting hammered latey, but it seems that only good news is getting \"priced in\" to the stock and bad news either ignored, heavily discounted, or immediately swept aside by larger related news affecting the marco equation (e.g., tariffs, deregulation, etc.).

Rebranding the Cybertruck dumpster fire as an F-150/GM truck replacement and pumping out the 2019 news of the old Semi project seems desperate to me.

The decline occurred over approximately 2.5 years, from March 2000 to October 2002. Cisco was a flagship tech stock during the dot-com bubble, fueled by speculative exuberance and overvaluation (trading at 220x earnings in 2000). The bubble burst due to unrealistic valuations, drying up of venture capital, and reduced demand for networking equipment as dot-com companies collapsed.\n\nBefore the bubble burst, Cisco Systems had a significant following that could be described as cult-like among investors, analysts, and tech enthusiasts. This fervor was driven by Cisco\u2019s dominance in the networking equipment market, its skyrocketing stock price, and the broader speculative mania surrounding internet-related companies. \n\nThe term \u201ccult stock\u201d (sounds familiar to meme stock?) was used in financial circles to describe companies with fervent investor bases, and Cisco fit this mold due to its perceived invulnerability and widespread ownership (it was held by many mutual funds and individual portfolios).\n\nDead Cat Bounce During the Decline:\n\nApril\u2013May 2000: After an initial drop post-March 2000, Cisco\u2019s stock briefly rallied, gaining approximately 10\u201315% over 10\u201315 trading days, before resuming its downtrend. This was part of the broader NASDAQ\u2019s temporary recovery.\n\nEarly 2001: A rally following Federal Reserve rate cuts saw Cisco\u2019s stock rise by about 20% over roughly 10 trading days, but the gains were short-lived as economic fundamentals remained weak.\n\nLate 2001 to Early 2002: Another bounce occurred, with the stock climbing from around $13 to $20 over approximately 15\u201320 trading days, before falling to its October 2002 low.\n\nCisco\u2019s bounces were driven by temporary optimism, policy interventions, or short covering, but the overarching bear market and overvaluation prevented sustained recovery.",

Charging 1 electric vehicle to full charge take roughly 100 kwh. 1 million new electric cars charging daily would take 100 gigawatts of capacity. \n\nFrom a charging stand point alone this business is not currently feasible and certainly not by 2026 as he has said. This does not even touch the logistics of liability, charging, app/software infrastructure. What happens if the app crashes or a robo bricks in the middle of the highway or gets in an accident or simply gets stuck. \n\nAm I the only one who looks at this business model and company claims and is scratching his head going how is this logistically going to work and then stay under Tesla?\n\nDisclosure: I own puts and calls on Tesla (short term).",

    "title": "Volkswagen Overtakes Tesla in European EV Market for the First Time",
    "selftext": "Volkswagen has officially surpassed Tesla in electric vehicle (EV) sales across Europe during the first quarter of 2025, marking a significant shift in the region\u2019s fast-evolving EV landscape. The German automaker achieved a strong performance with three models ranking among the top ten best-selling battery electric vehicles (BEVs).\n\n**Europe\u2019s EV Market Sees Record-Breaking Quarter**\n\nMarch 2025 became the second-best month on record for EV registrations in Europe, with 240,891 new BEVs hitting the roads \u2014 a 23% increase compared to March 2024. Electric vehicles accounted for 17% of the total market share, meaning nearly one in five new cars registered was electric.\n\nWhile the figure still falls short of the all-time high of 275,108 BEVs registered in December 2022, it contributed to making Q1 2025 the most successful quarter for BEV sales in European history.\n\n**Tesla\u2019s Decline Despite Model Y Juniper Launch**\n\nDespite launching the updated Model Y Juniper, Tesla continued to struggle with declining sales. According to data from JATO Dynamics, Tesla retained its title as the top-selling BEV brand in March 2025, although its registrations dropped 30% year-over-year.\n\nThat said, the monthly decline was less severe compared to the drops in January (-47%) and February (-44%), offering a slight silver lining for the U.S. automaker.\n\n**Volkswagen Takes the Lead**\n\nTesla\u2019s downward trend led to its fall to second place in the quarterly rankings, with 53,237 BEVs registered \u2014 a 38% year-on-year decrease. In contrast, Volkswagen posted a 157% surge, registering 65,679 units and claiming the top spot.\n\nBMW also showed strong momentum, selling 46,557 BEVs \u2014 a 21% increase \u2014 while Audi and Renault rounded out the top five with 34,739 (+51%) and 31,880 (+89%) units sold, respectively.\n\n[Source](https://auto1news.com/volkswagen-overtakes-tesla-in-european-ev-market-for-the-first-time/)\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Big Tech\u2019s Earnings Problem Is Estimates May Be Way Too High",
    "selftext": ">The last time Big Tech delivered earnings,\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0had just started his term, stocks were soaring on expectations of a pro-growth government agenda and investors\u2019 main worry was how long it would take companies to convert their artificial intelligence spending into profits.\n\n>Three months later, they are facing a far bleaker picture.\n\n>This week\u2019s quarterly results from\u00a0Microsoft Corp.,\u00a0Apple Inc.,\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc\u00a0will land in a market obsessed with every twist of a trade war that\u2019s wiped $5.5 trillion from the\u00a0S&P 500 Index. AI concerns have taken a back seat to angst over the possibility of a tariff-induced recession, while safe havens like gold have become the trade de jour for investors too rattled to buy stocks on the cheap.\n\n>Even with all the uncertainty, Wall Street isn\u2019t giving the companies\u2019 estimates much wiggle room. Analysts expect the so-called Magnificent Seven \u2014 which also includes Google-parent\u00a0Alphabet,\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Nvidia Corp.\u00a0\u2014 to deliver an average of 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that\u2019s barely budged since the start of March despite the flareup in trade tensions.\n\n>That raises the stakes for the four megacaps reporting this week, which collectively have a nearly 20% weighting in the S&P 500. Traders are unlikely to forgive earnings shortfalls in an already fearful market climate, despite steep declines in the stocks\u2019 share prices and improved valuations. Dire outlooks from the industry behemoths would also be poorly received, especially if they bolster\u00a0fears\u00a0of muted corporate spending ahead.\n\n>\u201cAny modicum of a weaker than expected number is going to cause a further selloff because of the concern around tariffs,\u201d said\u00a0Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, who believes this year\u2019s weakness in megacaps is a buying opportunity.\n\n>Markets got an early read on how Big Tech might be faring last week. Tesla reported its\u00a0worst quarter\u00a0in years, though traders cheered signs that chief executive\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0intends to step away from his government work and focus more on the electric-vehicle maker. Alphabet\u00a0beat expectations\u00a0but offered little future guidance. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7\u00a0index\u00a0jumped 9.1% last week amid a broader market rebound, though it\u2019s still down 15% in 2025.\n\n>A deeper look comes during a two-day stretch that starts with results from Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday. While many executives have declined to predict how tariffs might impact their bottom lines, Wall Street has been doing its own math. Based on a 22% tariff rate modeled by Bloomberg Economics, lower gross margins could result in a net income contraction of about 7% in 2025 for the S&P 500, compared with the current consensus estimate of nearly 12% growth,\u00a0wrote\u00a0Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity strategist\u00a0Gina Martin Adams.\n\n>Another key area of focus will be spending: The four biggest spenders \u2014 Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta \u2014 are projected to pour roughly $300 billion into capital expenditures in their current fiscal years. While the companies have pledged to maintain that pace in 2025, Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0sudden decision\u00a0to pause work on some data centers suggests cloud computing providers may be re-evaluating expenditures.\n\n>Apple, one of the companies most exposed to tariffs due to its supply chain reliance on China, may benefit from a pull-forward in demand from consumers seeking to avoid higher prices. However, those sales are seen as a one-off benefit, with tariffs sapping demand in future quarters. Amazon faces tariff risks to its e-commerce and advertising businesses, though a hit to profits could be cushioned by earnings in its high-margin web services unit, according to Jefferies analyst\u00a0Brent Thill.\n\n>That said, there\u2019s little expectation that executives will be able to give estimates with any degree of confidence, given the high level of macroeconomic uncertainty.\u00a0American Airlines Group Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Skechers USA Inc.\u00a0are among companies that have\u00a0abandoned\u00a0forecasts this quarter.\n\n>Michael Shaoul, founder of the ION Macro Fund, said it will be difficult for executives to convince the market that they have a true view into financial performance in coming quarters.\n\n>\u201cI think the more experienced management aren\u2019t even going to try,\u201d he said.\n\n>A bullish argument, of course, is that tech giants\u2019 dominant industry positions and robust balance sheets make them better suited to withstand an economic downturn than other companies \u2014 even if the earnings picture is cloudy. The Magnificent Seven are also less richly valued following the recent selloff: Alphabet, for example, trades at 17 times profits estimated over the next 12 months, compared with an average over the past decade of 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n>That could boost the appeal of the Magnificent Seven to dip-buyers, especially if signs of easing in the global trade war emerge. A flash of that came last week, when stocks soared after Trump\u00a0said\u00a0a deal with Beijing would significantly reduce the tariffs he\u2019s posted on Chinese goods.\n\n>But for\u00a0Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, it all comes down to the denominator in the price-to-earnings ratio.\n\n>\u201cThe valuations are getting more interesting down here, but we haven\u2019t pulled the trigger yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of questions on the E-side of the equation.\u201d\n\n\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-27/big-tech-s-earnings-problem-is-estimates-may-be-way-too-high](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-27/big-tech-s-earnings-problem-is-estimates-may-be-way-too-high)",

    "selftext": "Alphabet\u00a0reported Thursday that Waymo, its autonomous vehicle unit, is now delivering more than 250,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in the U.S.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo has options in terms of \u201cbusiness models across geographies,\u201d and the robotaxi company is building partnerships with ride-hailing app Uber, automakers and operations and maintenance businesses that tend to its vehicle fleets.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t possibly do it all ourselves,\u201d said Pichai on a call with analysts for Alphabet\u2019s\u00a0first-quarter earnings.\u00a0\n\nPichai noted that Waymo has not entirely defined its long-term business model, and there is \u201cfuture optionality around personal ownership\u201d of vehicles equipped with Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology. The company is also exploring the ways it can scale up its operations, he said.\n\nThe 250,000 paid rides per week are up from 200,000 in February, before Waymo opened in\u00a0Austin\u00a0and expanded in the\u00a0San Francisco Bay Area\u00a0in March.\u00a0\n\nWaymo, which is part of Alphabet\u2019s Other Bets segment, is already running its commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin regions.\n\nEarlier this month, Waymo and its partner Uber, began allowing interested riders to sign up to try the robotaxi service in Atlanta when it opens this summer.\u00a0\n\nThe early pioneer in self-driving technology, Waymo has managed to beat Elon Musk-led\u00a0Tesla\u00a0and a myriad of now-defunct autonomous vehicle startups to the U.S. market.\n\nTesla is promising that it will be able to turn its Model Y SUVs into robotaxis by the end of June for a driverless ride-hailing service it plans to launch in Austin.\n\nAfter about a decade of promises and missed deadlines, Tesla\u00a0still does not offer a vehicle that\u2019s safe to use without a human at the wheel ready to steer or brake at all times.\n\nMusk criticized Waymo\u2019s approach to driverless tech on his company\u2019s\u00a0first-quarter earnings\u00a0call on Tuesday. Musk said Waymo autonomous vehicles are \u201cvery expensive\u201d and made in only \u201clow volume.\u201d Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems rely mostly on cameras to navigate, while Waymo\u2019s driverless systems rely on lidar technology, other sensors and cameras.\n\nWould-be competitors to Waymo also include\u00a0Amazon-owned Zoox, Mobileye, May Mobility and international autonomous vehicle companies such as WeRide and Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/waymo-reports-250000-paid-robotaxi-rides-per-week-in-us.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/waymo-reports-250000-paid-robotaxi-rides-per-week-in-us.html)",

    "title": "Tesla Earnings: The Old Used Kleenex Trick Works Again",
    "selftext": "Well... Tesla bulls cheered after one of the worst earnings reports in company history (maybe even *the* worst). Here is the high level takeaway from Barron's:\n\n\"*Tesla stock is surging, but make no mistake: The quarter wasn\u2019t good. The stock reaction is more of a lesson in expectations and the stock market rather than a financial one.*\n\n*Sales, operating profit, and net income fell 9%, 66%, and 39% year over year. That belies how weak the EV business is currently. From peak quarterly levels, Tesla\u2019s sales are 25% lower and net income is 77% lower. First-quarter operating profit is down 90% from a fourth-quarter 2022 peak of $3.9 billion.*\" \n\n(Source: [Tesla: Just How Bad Was This Quarter?](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/tesla-earnings-stock-price-musk/card/just-how-bad-was-this-quarter))\n\nI keep using my facetious tech-jargony term: ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to explain how Elon can overcome even the worst news with hype. But it is a real thing! And it really works.\n\nHere is the bottom line if you are a Tesla bull: Elon can tell the markets to ignore all of 2025, plummeting sales, self-created political drama and chaos, complete lack of focus in his leadership at the company, brand damage, endless delays, failed product launches (e.g., Cybertruck), rising competition, need to replace 4M computers in their cars to get anything resembling FSD so they don't get sued (again), and losing 90% of the company's operating profit and turn it into a juicy buying opportunity. \n\nThe ticker doesn't lie. The stock goes up as the profit goes down (dramatically), driving the P/E ratio even further away from reality, now approaching jaw-dropping \\~150x. And the stock still going up this morning. Bulls win. Again.\n\nFor those of us outside the grip of the ERDF, here is my take on the earnings: It was basically a used Kleenex being used by Elon to clean up his \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (you fill in the blank in the comments- make us laugh). It was the same old news being reused to wipe away the reality of a failing and desperate company.\n\n**----End main post. Begin TLDR analysis. Don't read it if you are just going to complain----**\n\nBelow is one obvious fact, three used Kleenex, and what I see priced into the stock at this time:\n\n**Fact:** Trump is indeed giving Elon the widely expected quid pro quo deal for buying him the White House. Remember the tariff \"news\" that was released right at the same time Tesla's horrid sales numbers were released a few weeks ago? Well, we got the same thing for the predictable dumpster fire of an earnings report yesterday. Trump is moving the macro elements in the markets by timing his \"tariff on/off\" switch to boost a single stock of the company owned by the person that got him elected. \n\nIt's simple: Elon buys Trump the White House. Trump buys Elon more time to make is car company \"not-a-car-company\" by keeping the stock pumped. Elon is acting as a heat shield for Trump by doing the dirty work of cutting jobs with DOGE and Trump is acting as a heat shield for Tesla's stock. I bet we will see another White House sales special when the \"low cost\" car comes up for sale too.\n\n**Used Kleenex #1:** ERDF has achieved FSD mode as long as Elon keeps his hand on the wheel 2-3 days out of the week for Tesla. The news that was already known by the law mandates the term for Special Advisors to the President be limited to 130-days per calendar year, was deployed again. This same (not actual news) news release was already made and already got the stock to pop. But Elon isn't really leaving. According to the man himself, he is still going to be splitting his time between DOGE and Tesla, giving each a few days a week. And don't forget about SpaceX, X, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, 14-kids and counting, and all the other stuff he spends his time on like gaming. But trust him: He is really going to focus this time. Seriously guys. \n\n**Used Kleenex #2:** Tesla is now going to make that low cost EV that Elon called \"silly\" and \"pointless\" just a few months ago (Source: [Elon Musk Says Making a $25,000 EV Is \u2018Silly\u2019 and \u2018Pointless\u2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-says-making-25-144109165.html)). But this is not going to be a \"new\" car. This is going to be a stripped down version of a Model Y or 3 (Source: [Tesla\u2019s Dirt-Cheap EV Might Just Be A Basic Model 3 Or Y](https://insideevs.com/news/757410/tesla-affordable-model-stripped-down/)). This will allow them to use the same production lines and just strip out as much as they can as fast as they can. \n\nThis is looking more like a B-52 bomber that is running on fumes while the crew is frantically throwing as much out the window to drop weight before they crash and burn. It is clearly an act of desperation. Tesla is either doing upgrades to the same cars (e.g., the Juniper) or downgrades to the same cars. Nothing new. The only \"new\" think Tesla has done is the Cybertruck, which has been one of the biggest failures in automotive history. \n\n\\*FYI: There is a low cost Tesla on the market. It's called a used Tesla. And there are plenty of them available right now. \n\n**Used Kleenex #3:** More empty promises of the same late-to-market vaporware. The cars will achieve full self-driving (FSD), the Robotaxi will launch, and Optimus will take over all tasks for humans everywhere. But not really. FSD will be diluted to something you need to assist and delays will be blamed on something other than Tesla's mismanagement (e.g., George Soros, red tape, etc.). About 10-20 older model Teslas with upgraded computers will start giving rides around Austin (probably to employees only). And the Optimus, for which there is no consumer market or supply chain for, will be doing a few things for a demo reel around the Tesla factory floor.  \n\nHow many times can Elon use the same Kleenex before the market throws it out? Your guess is as good as mine...\n\n**Here is what is priced in:** Perfection, fruit fly brain, harder things being made easy, no risk, and no competition. \n\nThe markets are signaling that Tesla management will masterfully navigate any brand damage with absolute perfection. Despite not having managed anything very well in the past, this is being seen as a complete non-issue for the company. Basically, the market is expecting all consumers to have the memory of a fruit fly and all of Elon's public chainsaw wielding insanity will blow over in a few months time. And of course, that he will not do or say anything stupid again after being unable to do so since his inception. Most importantly, no brand damage will affect any of the future products being launched this year (but not really) because consumers with the brain's of a fruit fly won't associate other Tesla products with Tesla. Makes sense right?\n\nThe only new Tesla has made in the vehicle space is the Cybertruck. They used glue to attach the body panels and it fell apart, requiring a 100% recall. It has been one of the worst failures in automotive history. Doing things like FSD, integrating AI, and making humanoid robots that seamlessly work alongside humans are astronomically more challenging by comparison. And we are supposed to believe that the company still can't build a vehicle with any level of acceptable quality after decades of trying will be able to pull off much harder technical challenges in just a few months? Makes sense right?\n\nThe markets are ignoring all competition and looking at Tesla as the only potential beneficiary of it's EVs and vaporware. BYD is very real in the EV space and has already taken over global sales without even having access to the US market. Toyota is about to be crushing it in the US EV market (do your own research- it's coming). They already have a low cost EV that is so popular in China it crashed their servers with so many people trying to order it (Source: [Meet Toyota\u2019s cheapest EV in China, the bZ3X](https://electrek.co/2025/03/06/toyotas-cheapest-ev-china-crashes-server-starting-at-15000/)). Meanwhile, Tesla just has used Kleenex and a driving dumpster fire to offer.\n\nThat little tech company known as \"Google\" already has a robotaxi service up and running in cities across America with their company Waymo. They are way ahead. There is even more competition in this space such as Zoox. And there are already tech savvy taxi services available in Uber and Lyft. People can get a cab ride pretty easy these days. This space has very heavy competition already and Tesla is way behind but they are being valued as if they will be the first and only taxi service available. \n\nAgain, the markets assume there will be no brand damage here. Why will consumers pick Tesla's Cybercab over everything else? Because they like getting flicked off while being driven somewhere? Let's be honest: Nothing will make you look cooler in America's predominantly left-leaning cities than stepping out of a Tesla Cybercab to meet your friends for dinner at your favorite restaurant. You will look even cooler if you throw your buddies an \"elbowless wave\" when you get out.  \n\nTesla's robotaxi effort is being viewed as \"no-risk\" endeavor. Basically, if Tesla launches, nothing could go wrong. GM's Cruise already learned this is not the case when they launched ahead of Tesla (Source: [GM\u2019s Cruise Halts All US Robotaxi Service After Suspension for Pedestrian Who Was Dragged](https://www.wired.com/story/gms-cruise-halts-self-driving-operations-regulator-safety-fears/)). Given Tesla's track record of launching products before they are ready, do people really think nothing has the potential to go wrong here? Accidents happen. Even if the tech is better than humans, accidents will still happen. And Tesla will be an easy target with deep pockets for the blood sucking lawyers to go after. They are already settling wrongful death suits for their cars that are at least partially operated by humans (Source: [Tesla settles lawsuit over Autopilot crash that killed Apple engineer](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/08/tesla-settles-wrongful-death-lawsuit-over-fatal-2018-autopilot-crash.html)). Putting millions of self-driving robotaxis on the road all at once will only increase the odds and number of accidents. Without tort reform, accounting for losses due to litigation, this is likely to be a money losing endeavor and not the huge potential source of future profits the market is expecting it to be. \n\nLastly, my favorite piece of vaporware: The Optimus robot. This rehash of the old ASIMO from Honda is the dumbest thing ever. There is absolutely no consumer market for this whatsoever. As Honda learned, the risks are huge here. As soon as these heavy robots lands on a human when they fall over and hurts them, it's game over. This will be a class action drool fest for the lawyers out there. I can see the billboards already: \"Have you been hurt by an Optimus? Call 1-800-SUE-ELON\". \n\nTesla can't get cars with four-wheels to drive themselves down paved roads with painted lines on them. And they are somehow going to recreate a far more complex bipedal human that operates in free space with a robot using the same computer? Yeah, not going to happen except in vaporware demos using AI to generate imagery. This is ten years out at a minimum and would require a massive investment that has yet to be made. It is far more challenging than making EVs (even FSD EVs). Show me one of these robots walk into house with toys randomly scattered on the floor, unload groceries, and prepare a scrambled egg and I will eat my words (along with the egg). \n\nThe commercial application for the Optimus is also nonsense with other competition already way out in front. BMW is working with company called Figure that is using it's second generation of humanoid robots to build cars in Spartanburg, SC (Source: [Humanoid Robots for BMW Group Plant Spartanburg](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html)). And let's all conveniently forget the robots coming out of China (check them out for yourself). Again, Tesla is way behind here and being viewed as the only player in this space and the only potential beneficiary of any future humanoid robot. It's simply ridiculous. \n\nI end with this: The powerful ERDF is real and continues to provide Elon and Tesla with an endless supply of investors with exuberant and cult-like belief in anything he says that will willfully ignore reality along with all past performance and competition. Beware. ",

    "title": "Tesla Robotaxi - Musk sees it as infinite money hack - My crude study gets profit of $18.57 per share if it entirely displaced Uber & Lyft.",
    "selftext": "TESLA profits go\u00a0**down**\u00a070%, stock goes\u00a0**up**\u00a07%. Pretty inexplicable other than hopes and dreams propping it up.\n\nA main component of the hopium is Musk continuing to dangle robotaxi out there. Notably, this is now the 11th years where Musk has \"hoped\" to have robotaxi in the next year (its shooting to have test robotaxis going in Austin in June, but there were some acknowledgments on the earnings call there would be remote operator standby assistance for those in case of issues, meaning it will not be a true robotaxi yet).\n\nMusk continually touts robotaxi as a seemingly infinite money hack where there has \"never be anything like this rapid of value creation\" in the history of mankind. Nobody seems to be pushing back on this so let's see where we're at actually at with the value of a robotaxi. This is a crude study of how to value robotaxi.\n\n**First,**\u00a0Musk said on the earnings call that people will not own cars in the future; instead, everybody will just use robotaxis. I disagree with this. Even if robotaxis exist, if cars are still in the $20k to $50k range (which is already the case and EVs are getting cheaper), I expect most people that currently own a vehicle would still want to own one if they're still affordable - among other reasons, you would want to know you have a vehicle for your own personal use and is there when you want to use it, you may not want strangers sitting in your vehicle and farting in the seats all day etc.\n\nFrom this perspective, it begins to look more like Tesla would be displacing Uber and Lyft - i.e., the current rideshare businesses - as opposed to literally everybody everywhere not owning a car and only using robotaxi.\n\n**Second,**\u00a0from a business component, and from Google searches, it appears as though Uber and Lyft charge, all-in, about $1.80/mile, with Uber and Lyft getting about a 30% cut, or $0.54 per mile. Uber and Lyft had a combined 2024 revenue of $49.7 billion. This would translate to\u00a0**92.03 billion miles driven in 2024 across Uber and Lyft.**\n\n**Third**, if we assume the robotaxi version Tesla manages to produce will cost about $25k, and dividing that by the average car lifespan of 160,000 miles (from a Google search), we get the cost per mile to build the robotaxi of $0.15 per mile.\n\n**Fourth**, now, if we assume Tesla undercuts Uber and Lyft (as it would have to in order to take away their market share), and we assume Tesla undercuts them by 50%, then we end up with Tesla charging $0.90 per mile. Subtract out the $0.15 per mile of the cost of building the robotaxi and we end up with $0.65 per mile profit (this is a crude, and high approximation for profit as it ignores business overhead, maintenance expenses for the car, etc.).\n\nAt $0.65 per mile profit, and if it took all 99.4 billion miles that Uber and Lyft drove last year, that would mean Tesla\u00a0**generates an annual profit off of robotaxis of $59.8 billion**. With Tesla having 3.22 billion shares outstanding, this would be\u00a0**profit of $18.57 a share**. If we gave that\u00a0**Uber's P/E ratio of 16**\u00a0you end up with\u00a0**$297 a share**.\n\n**Summary**: If we approximated Tesla robotaxi as completely displacing Uber and Lyft - i.e., effectively the entire ride-share market - and Tesla undercut Uber and Lyft by charging for rides 50% as expensive as Uber and Lyft, and Tesla had a 70% profit margin on those rides,\u00a0**could get $18.57 profit a share and at a P/E of 16 like Uber, would be a share price of $297.**\n\nThe share price/value creation potential actually is pretty significant, but, notably, even if it entirely displaced Uber and Lyft, a $297 share price would only be an 18% increase from where it is now at $250.\n\nAnd, if robotaxi doesn't pan out in nearly the way Musk hopes, there is way more downside than the 30% upside as the fair value of Tesla from a car manufacturer perspective is probably under $100 per share, potentially under $50 a share.\n\nNotably, this analysis does not factor in company and administrative expenses as to costs per mile for robotaxi, nor does it factor in that competition may drive Tesla ride prices lower than 50% of what Uber and Lyft are current charging - e.g., Waymo or other robotaxi services that will inevitably come about. Nor does it factor in Musk's Optimus robot nonsense as that is far, far too speculative. It also ignores the profits Tesla would make on cars it sold since, as recent earnings have shown, it's profit on car sales is now about $0.12 a quarter and would me marginal compared to the $18.57 a share profit from robotaxi.\n\n\u00a0I'm not a Tesla fanboy. I was just curious if there's even some plausible route for Tesla to justify its valuation. The answer is there is a route where robotaxi could be lucrative enough to get there, although it's not very probable as it requires virtually no competition and for Tesla to actually deliver on robotaxi.\n\nSomething to think about. Curious people's take on this.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks)\n\n[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.\n\n[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) **/** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.\n\n[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d)\\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy \"genericized\" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.\n\n[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&p=d)\\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints. \n\n**Earnings today:** IBM",

    "title": "Tesla Earnings: Two predictions and what to watch for after.",
    "selftext": "Position: I am short on Tesla.\n\nApparently, Elon is going to talk today: [Elon Musk breaks his own Tesla (TSLA) earnings rule in desperate move](https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/elon-musk-breaks-tesla-tsla-earnings-rule-desperate-move/)\n\nWe all know what this is about: Building hype to distract from the endless onslaught of bad news for Tesla. Elon is going to deploy his ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to pump up his meme stock. This comes as no surprise to anyone here. \n\nPrediction #1: Taking the likely prediction from the Tesla bulls, Elon will tell investors the same old story of Tesla becoming \"not-a-car-company\" anymore and to completely ignore all of 2025. (Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html) ). Also, not really a big stretch of the imagination here. \n\nPrediction #2: Just for fun, I will make a very specific prediction of how Elon will use his ERDF to dazzle the mouth breathers into dumping more money into his meme stock. I expect that he will roll out the Optimus. It will do the following tasks, in order:\n\n1. Perform some silly preprogrammed maneuver that makes it look like it is self-aware. It will look at it's hands or something similar to make it look like it has \"intelligence\" and \"awareness\". Just watch the dumb video they have already put out there.\n2. Elon will throw a bunch of small, non-fragile, objects out on a flat surface and say: \"*Now watch this!*\". \n3. The robot will quickly grab each small object, maybe something like a domino, and arrange them quickly in an ordered fashion. It might even flick the first one to knock down the chain. \n4. Controlled remotely by a human off stage, the robot will wave goodbye to a choreographed verbal prompt from Elon and then walk off the stage. Maybe it will even do a little dance for us. \n5. The bleating sheep will go nuts and the stock will pop. \n6. End sham demo. \n7. Begin hand-waving and tech-jargon spewing to explain away endless mounting problems for Tesla. \n\nI predict this because of Elon's long history of stage-hyped vaporware demos. This will be really easy for him to pull off because they can just rip a few sensors and software out of the common pick-and-place robots already used in their production lines and quickly cobble them into the Optimus. It is going to look just like the pre-canned routines production robots run at manufacturing trade shows but for dimwits that have never been to one and think this is all \"new\" technology. \n\nMost importantly: This will gloss over the inconvenient fact that any \"brand damage\" Elon has caused Tesla, will also surely impact the sales of any other consumer product they will launch in the future. For example, an obscenely expensive robot that will likely be unable to scramble an egg for you. \n\nThe whole \"Tesla is not-a-car-company anymore\" earnings (so ignore the lack of earnings) show will also gloss over the fact that, like everything else \"new\" at Tesla, it is an old idea and they are way behind the competition (e.g., Waymo/Google in the Robotaxi space). The idea of a car company making humanoid robots was first put out there by Honda with ASIMO over a quarter century ago. They developed it. There was no consumer market for it. So, they repurposed it. There still isn't a consumer market here (longer discussion). And there is already a second generation of advanced humanoid robots for manufacturing from a company called [Figure building BMW's in Spartanburg, SC](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html). Let's also just ignore all the more advanced humanoid robots coming out of China just like we are told to ignore BYD that just surpassed Tesla without even having access to the US market. If Elon says it's the future, it \"Musk\" be true, and Tesla will somehow be the ***only*** company in the world doing it. \n\nWill Tesla's stock pop today? Probably. But who really knows with any meme stock. Performance and numbers haven't mattered at all in the past for Tesla. Retail investors are just a herd of bleating sheep that will easily get caught up in the ERDF. What I am going to be looking for is 45 days\u00a0from the end of Q1 when the data from the 13F Forms comes out. Watching what the big institutional investors are doing will really be telling. I strongly suspect, given previous reports of retail investors buying up [Tesla like never before](https://www.investopedia.com/why-teslas-stock-soars-despite-car-sales-numbers-11705040), that the institutional investors are going to slowly reduce their positions in Tesla and orchastate themselves a nice soft landing on the backs of gullible retail investors. Given that institutional investors hold about half the company, I predict that this news is what will really drive the stock price for the foreseeable future. ",

Analysts anticipate EPS of $0.41 and revenue of $21.54B, reflecting a 13% YoY decline in deliveries to \\~337K units. TSLA faces challenges from declining EV sales, brand damage, and potential impacts from new auto tariffs. I'm mainly interested in sub-$200 buys as a small reversal trade, not sure if I'll take a short position prior to earnings. Not interested in trading if the earnings are good. Risks include continued decline in deliveries, margin compression, and potential regulatory impacts from tariffs. Something else I'm interested in listening for is lessened political risk- if Elon is announcing an actual step down from DOGE then that might help the stock.\n\n[**SEDG (SolarEdge)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SEDG&p=d) / [**FSLR (First Solar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FSLR&p=d) \\- The U.S. has finalized tariffs up to 3,521% on solar imports from Southeast Asia, targeting countries like Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Most of our solar capability is imported from SE Asian countries. This move is meant to protect domestic manufacturers like SEDG and FSLR. Not too interested in this as a day trade, more as a swing trade.\n\n[**NOC (Northrop Grumman)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NOC&p=d) \\- Northrop Grumman reported a 49% drop in Q1 profit, with EPS of $3.32 vs. $6.32 YoY, due to a $477M charge related to the B-21 stealth bomber program. Revenue fell 7% YoY to $9.47B, missing expectations. Overall, many defense companies are losers from tariffs due to rising production costs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Companies like NOC are under pressure to manage expenses while maintaining strategic programs which are essentially impossible due to tariffs. Risks include escalating costs in defense projects, potential delays in government contracts, and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n[**JKS (JinkoSolar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JKS&p=d) \\- JinkoSolar, with U.S. manufacturing capabilities, stands to benefit from the new tariffs on Southeast Asian solar imports. Despite initial market reaction, the company's domestic presence positions it favorably in the current trade environment. FSLR and other domestic producers cannot manufacture the entire US's solar needs by themselves- JKS is likely to pick up the slack with their own manufacturing. But frankly, FSLR/ENPH/domestic producers are safer trades IMO.\n\nEarnings today: TSLA!",

The shares are now down 44% for the year after wrapping up their worst quarter since 2022 in March. It\u2019s the 12th time this year the stock has dropped by at least 5% in a single session.\n\nCEO Elon Musk\u2019s many distractions outside of Tesla, especially his role within the Trump administration, are in focus, along with the company\u2019s progress on a long-delayed robotaxi and self-driving technology for its existing cars.\n\nIn the online forum that Tesla uses to solicit investor inquiries in advance of its earnings calls, more than 300 questions were submitted pertaining to Tesla\u2019s self-driving systems, around 200 came in about the company\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots in development, and more than 160 questions poured in about Musk individually. One investor asked, \u201cWhat steps has the board of directors taken to mitigate the brand damage caused by Elon\u2019s political activities?\u201d\n\nAfter spending $290 million to help return Trump to the White House, Musk is now leading an initiative to slash tens of thousands of federal jobs, sell off or end leases for federal office buildings, and reduce U.S. government capacity.\n\nMusk\u2019s politics and antics have elicited a massive backlash in Europe and parts of the U.S. This year, the company has been hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported 336,681 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, a 13% decline from the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe company is expected to report revenue of $21.24 billion for the first quarter, according to LSEG, which would mark a slight drop from the same period last year. Analysts expect earnings per share of 40 cents. Investors will be paying particularly close attention to any commentary about Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs and the potential impact on revenue and earnings as the year progresses.\n\nOppenheimer analysts wrote in a note out Monday that \u201congoing brand erosion\u201d for Tesla in the U.S. and Europe is weighing on sales already, but a \u201cbigger issue for the company is potential weakness in China demand and margin impact due to the Trump tariffs.\u201d\n\nThey wrote that competition in China, coupled with \u201cnationalistic\u201d consumer trends there, could \u201cdrive sales toward domestic brands.\u201d Tesla would then have to export more of its China-made cars, which could lead to \u201cdownward pressure on pricing,\u201d the Oppenheimer analysts said.\n\nCaliber, a research firm that tracks how U.S. consumer sentiment is shifting around major brands, found that only 27% of its survey respondents in March would consider purchasing a Tesla, compared to 46% in January 2022.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, is hoping for a \u201cturnaround vision\u201d from Musk on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call.\n\n\u201cTesla has now unfortunately become a political symbol globally of the Trump Administration/DOGE,\u201d he wrote, noting that \u201cTesla\u2019s stock has been crushed since Trump stepped back into the White House.\u201d\n\nIves estimated 15% to 20% \u201cpermanent demand destruction for future Tesla buyers due to the brand damage Musk has created\u201d by working for Trump.\n\nLate last week, Barclays maintained the equivalent of a sell rating and slashed its price target on Tesla to $275 from $325, citing a \u201cconfusing set-up\u201d on the first-quarter with \u201cweak fundamentals.\u201d The firm said it could see a positive reaction if Musk is more focused on his automaker, and depending on what the company discloses about an anticipated \u201cFSD event,\u201d referring to Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving offering.\n\nTesla said in\u00a0announcing its reporting date\u00a0that, in addition to earnings, it will provide a \u201clive company update,\u201d language the company hasn\u2019t typically used in disclosures.\n\nSource: [Tesla shares tumble ahead of first-quarter earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/21/tesla-shares-tumble-ahead-of-first-quarter-earnings-report.html)",

The lines between sectors have blurred so much that traditional sector diversification doesn\u2019t work like it used to.\n\n3.

When volatility hits, they tend to rush for the exits at the same time, causing even traditionally uncorrelated assets to move in sync.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve observed in my portfolio and others is that during calm markets, everything seems fine and diversified. But the moment real stress hits, correlations spike across supposedly different assets and sectors. Real diversification today isn\u2019t about having different stocks or even different asset classes. It\u2019s about having exposure to fundamentally different economic forces and risk factors.",

    "title": "Predictions for the effect of Tesla earnings on Tuesday?",
    "selftext": "I am very much aware that Tesla is an irrational stock that is not attached to reality. It's somehow a cult of personality and meme stock that has one of the biggest market caps in the world. But as of a month ago, all the circumstances pointed towards the meme finally being ready to burst.\n\n1) It would be hard to pretend the company was still growing when it's clearly shrinking. Netflix lost subscribers for one quarter and the stock fell from $800 to $200 in a few days. (I know it recovered, but it shows the dramatic reaction the market has to the idea of a growth phase ending). Tesla trades at insane P/Es because it's priced like a tech startup ready to explode and it certainly would be hard to think of it as a company with infinite growth potential when it's objectively shrinking. If it were any other stock, objective data showing it to be a shrinking company would absolutely crush the stock price. A shrinking company operating at 150 P/E is absurd.\n\n2) The cult of personality was starting to fall apart as Elon became one of the most controversial and hated people in the world as he gleefully destroyed the US government and various other things like supporting the AfD.\n\n3) Tesla became one of the most hated companies in the world. Daily protests at Tesla dealerships, people embarrassed and/or scared to drive them, Elon alienates the demographic that would be interested in electric cars, and leans hard into the crowd that hates them. It got so bad that Tesla stopped taking their own trade-ins and their value on the used market is plumetting.\n\n4) 10+ years of broken \"just around the corner\" tech promises. I'd like to say you can't keep fooling people like that but, well, *points to reality*. They're nowhere near complete FSD, their robots are people in costumes, etc.\n\nIt seemed to me like the bubble around Tesla was ready to burst, and so I bought a lot of puts expiring between Apr 25 and May 16 as I expected the earnings report to be the unavoidable moment of reckoning that would force the market to face reality.\n\nOn the other hand\n\n1) Tesla seems to trade on an inverse news basis. Bad news for Tesla? Stock goes up. We saw the delivery numbers had declined a couple of weeks ago and the stock went up 5%. Will earnings day just be a repeat of that? We see objectively bad number and the stock paradoxically  soars?\n\n2) We're in a completely chaotic market right now where all anyone wants to know is whether Trump is going to commit national economic suicide or if he's going to pull out at the last second. I'm not sure any individual stock's merits matter at this point. It seems like the whole market is on hold, holding its breath, waiting to see if we're going to start Great Depression 2: Electric Boogaloo. If Trump caves, the market will soar. If we start seeing the effects of stopping the flow of Chinese goods, the market is finally going to have to recognize that the US has completely destroyed itself and it'll have to crash. In comparison, the performance for any particular stock now seems unimportant. So I worry that any news that's bad for Tesla ends up getting lost in all the noise of the much bigger issues.\n\n3) The Trump wildcard factor. When Tesla started to fall, Trump did a commercial from the white house for Tesler. If the stock starts to fall again, does Elon have the power to get him to do something crazy? Maybe another massive pump of the market with some fake tariff news that boosts the whole market and Tesla along with it? I'm not sure where Elon is at with Trump right now but I'm afraid with one tweet Trump could erase the effect of bad news on Tesla (while doing a trillion or two of damage in the process)\n\nI invested a significant amount of my portfolio in Tesla falling, particularly in the next 3 weeks. I made these investments a month or two ago when it seemed like a pretty good bet. Now I'm not sure what to expect. If earnings day goes by and Tesla stock doesn't care, or worse, paradoxically surges, I will have wasted quite a bit of investing.\n\nSo I'm curious what you guy think about what will happen this week for Tesla.",

    "selftext": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first\n\nNearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade \u2013 a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions \u2013 is over, according to the Bank of America\u2019s latest survey.\nOver the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump\u2019s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.\n\nWhile it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn\u2019t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall \u2013 a scenario today\u2019s US market is particularly vulnerable to.\nOne of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.\n\nSince 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc \u2013 over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: \u201cTechnology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.\u201d\nHowever, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.\n\nThe upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500\u2019s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.\n\nAll of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.\nIn fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.\nMarkets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.\nMr Gimber explains: \u201cOne of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.\n\u201cThis has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.\u201d\n",

Global production of the lower-cost Model Y, internally codenamed E41, is expected to begin in the United States, the sources said, but it would be at least months later than Tesla's public plan, they added, offering a range of revised targets from the third quarter to early next year.\n\nTwo of the people said Tesla aimed to produce 250,000 of the cheaper Model Ys in the United States in 2026. The new vehicle is also planned for eventual production in China and Europe, Reuters has previously reported. The delay of U.S. production and the U.S. production target have not been previously reported.\n\nTesla reports results on Tuesday, and plans for the new vehicles are a major question.\n\nThe less expensive mass-market vehicles have been widely anticipated by Tesla fans and investors who hope they will attract a fresh group of customers and reverse the EV maker's falling sales and eroding market share. Tesla also has refreshed its original Model Y with exterior and interior changes. The Long Range All-Wheel Drive version in the United States costs about $49,000, before a $7,500 federal tax credit.\n\nReuters reported last month that the China launch of the E41 will occur in 2026. The E41 will be smaller and cost 20% less to produce than the refreshed Model Y, the sources familiar with China plans told Reuters. The timing of the rollout in Europe is not clear.\n\nTesla is also planning to launch a bare-bones version of its Model 3 compact sedan, three people said.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the delay of production of the cheaper Model Y, production targets and other details reported here.\n\nThe EV maker on Jan. 2 reported its first decline in annual deliveries last year, and analysts expect sales to fall again this year for several reasons, including damage to the brand reputation by Chief Executive Elon Musk's close work with U.S. President Donald Trump and support of far-right European politicians.\n\nAnother challenge for Tesla is that its vehicles are aging and there is no relatively cheap model.\n\nMusk earlier promised a new, cheaper EV platform with cars expected to be priced as low as $25,000, but dropped that to prioritize robotaxi development.\n\nAutomakers are grappling with prospects of rising prices and supply-chain disruption, after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported from outside the United States.\n\nTesla has increased North American sourcing for parts of many models over the last two years, which would decrease tariff exposure for the E41, two people aware of the matter said. It recently suspended plans to ship components from China to the United States for the Cybercab and Semi truck due to tariffs, one person told Reuters earlier this week.",

The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.\n\nHinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.\n\nTesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.\n\nThe automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.\n\nIn March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.\n\nThe case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.",

    "title": "Leverage ETFs: Survive Volatility or Risk It All?",
    "selftext": "[Leverage ETF Chart: TSLL](https://preview.redd.it/6pvdswdnp3ve1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d3ed95977ea7cef512d66e9872be3452ba48f73)\n\n  \nLeverage ETFs offer a way to boost returns, but their risks can catch investors off guard in volatile markets. With global markets increasingly influenced by unpredictable factors like trade wars and political instability, the allure of quick profits from leverage ETFs can be tempting. However, Volatility can offer opportunities for significant gains, but it can also lead to devastating losses if investors are unprepared for the magnified downturns.\n\n# What Are Leverage ETFs?\n\nLeverage ETFs are investment vehicles that combine stocks and futures, aiming to track the daily returns of an underlying asset by a multiple of two or more. In the U.S., where the options market outshines the stock futures market, leverage ETFs rely on synthetic futures rather than actual futures. A synthetic future is constructed by buying a call option and selling a put option with the same strike price, mimicking the behavior of a futures contract. These transactions are facilitated through swap agreements, specifically Total Return Swaps (TRS), enabling the ETF to pursue leveraged returns on the underlying asset\n\n# How Daily Rebalancing Works\n\nA defining trait of leverage ETFs is their mandate to deliver at least double the daily return of the underlying asset. This requires constant adjustment of their synthetic futures positions in response to price changes. For instance, if Tesla\u2019s stock plummets by 50% on December 18, 2024, TSLL\u2014a leverage ETF tracking Tesla\u2014would see its value approach zero if it failed to adjust its holdings. To avoid this, TSLL must reduce its synthetic futures position when Tesla\u2019s price drops and increase it when the price rises, ensuring the daily 2x leverage target is met.\n\nThis adjustment process may not pose significant issues in short-term scenarios involving sharp declines followed by swift recoveries. Take 2022 as an example: a market crash followed by a rapid rebound limits the losses from rebalancing, keeping the \"negative compounding effect\" in check. In such cases, the erosion of the ETF\u2019s value remains less pronounced.\n\n# Risks in Volatile Markets\n\nHowever, the story shifts dramatically in volatile, range-bound markets. If Tesla\u2019s stock oscillates daily with 10% gains and losses, TSLL must buy additional synthetic futures on up days and sell them on down days. This pattern of buying high and selling low repeats, swiftly eroding the ETF\u2019s value.\n\nThis mirrors how a leverage ETF reduces its synthetic futures exposure as the underlying asset declines. Unlike stocks, which can simply be held, leverage ETFs must actively manage futures positions, making them more vulnerable in prolonged downturns. If the synthetic futures\u2019 leverage ratio reaches 20x, selling futures becomes critical to maintain the daily 2x tracking\u2014failure to do so undermines the ETF\u2019s objective.\n\n# Volatility, Time Decay, and Investment Strategy\n\nOption pricing, governed by the Black-Scholes model, hinges on volatility as a key determinant. While stock investors may not view volatility as embedded in price, options introduce the concept of time value. Leverage ETFs, utilizing options within synthetic futures, are thus subject to time decay. When the underlying asset moves sideways, this cost steadily chips away at returns.\n\nConsequently, leverage ETFs hold the most promise in short-term, trending markets where clear directionality can amplify gains. In contrast, volatile, directionless markets amplify losses, underscoring the need for careful market analysis before investing. A focus on short-term strategies rather than long-term holding, coupled with an awareness of volatility\u2019s impact, may offer a more prudent path for those considering these instruments.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.\nApproximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had \"all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.\"\n\nIn January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.\n\nGiven the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet. \n\nFor more detailed information, you can read the full article on Electrek:\n\nhttps://electrek.co/2025/04/14/tesla-tsla-replace-computer-4-million-cars-or-compensate-their-owners/",

    "selftext": "[Nasdaq 100 \\(NDX\\) Chart](https://preview.redd.it/967ivp69uwue1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=a46d263de6952e302dcc5a5111f69831d43edd33)\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index is currently encountering strong resistance around the 19,000 level, signaling the end of its technical rebound phase. This pattern echoes past periods of bear market entry, offering investors clues to anticipate the market\u2019s next moves. \n\nFor instance, in January 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening triggered a sudden plunge in the Nasdaq 100, with the index dropping over 20% from its peak. A brief technical rebound followed, but it faced resistance near 15,000 and resumed its decline. A similar scenario unfolded in early March 2020, when the Nasdaq 100 fell 20% from its high, entering a bear market. The 8,800 level acted as a strong resistance, and although an emergency Fed rate cut spurred a rebound, the index soon plummeted again. The current situation bears striking similarities.\n\nHistorically, entering a bear market often led to further declines. Yet, recent trends suggest this isn\u2019t always the case. In March 2020, swift Fed rate cuts and quantitative easing propelled U.S. markets to new highs almost immediately. Another example is December 20, 2018, when the Nasdaq 100 dropped over 20% from its peak, entering a bear market, only to rebound quickly after Fed Chair Powell hinted at pausing rate hikes. These instances show how sensitive markets can be to policy interventions, sometimes defying expectations with rapid recoveries. However, with aggressive rate cuts like those in 2020 unlikely today, the possibility of further weakness in the Nasdaq remains a concern.\n\nStock buybacks have long been a key driver of U.S. market gains, particularly for the Nasdaq. When Trump took office in 2017 and slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, companies redirected tax savings into buybacks. Apple, for example, ramped up its buybacks starting in 2018, spending $100 billion annually and boosting its stock price, pushing its market cap past $1 trillion that year. Recently, its market cap has neared $4 trillion, but the issue is that buyback amounts haven\u2019t scaled significantly\u2014remaining at $110 billion in 2024. Buying back $100 billion worth of stock when the market cap was under $1 trillion had a far greater impact than the same amount with a $3 trillion-plus valuation. To replicate past stock price surges, buybacks might need to reach $300 billion or more, yet there\u2019s little indication of such an increase. This suggests that the effectiveness of buybacks in propping up stock prices is waning.\n\nSince 2017, beyond buybacks, the activation of the stock options market and the rise in leveraged ETF assets have fueled Nasdaq gains. A surge in open interest in options has driven hedging demand\u2014say, a Tesla call option seller buying Tesla stock, positively impacting the cash market. Post-2020, the sharp increase in leveraged ETF assets has brought in fresh buying power, though it\u2019s a double-edged sword. Korean investors, in particular, have amplified U.S. market volatility by heavily purchasing leveraged ETFs. While this can lift prices in the short term, it also heightens market instability.\n\nTrump\u2019s policies are another critical factor. During his first term, tax cuts and surging buybacks drew global capital to U.S. markets, sparking a Nasdaq rally. In contrast, his second term\u2019s excessive tariffs are reversing this trend, triggering capital outflows from both U.S. stocks and bonds. The persistent decline in the dollar index exacerbates this, adding uncertainty. Unlike in March 2020, when Trump stabilized markets with a tariff suspension, his current policies are themselves a risk, eroding investor confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, as the Nasdaq\u2019s technical rebound draws to a close, investors should approach the market with caution, informed by historical patterns and economic indicators. The diminishing impact of buybacks, heightened volatility from leveraged ETFs, and uncertainties tied to Trump\u2019s policies point to potential downward pressure. Without significant Fed intervention, reviewing portfolio risks and leaning toward strategies that mitigate volatility seem prudent. **With signs of capital flight from U.S. markets emerging, flexibility in response could prove essential**.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Tesla's 50-day moving average is about to cross the 200-day, a bearish signal. Meanwhile, vehicle sales are slumping, while the valuation remains high.\n\nTesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse.\n\nThe stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla.\n\nNow, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.\n\nThe company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.\n\nBud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.\n\nBob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.\n\nWhat does the data tell us about Tesla's stock?\n\nIts technicals look rough\n\nIf you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Tesla was near the \"death cross\", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal.\n\n\"Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,\" Lang said.\n\nBelow is a chart from FactSet that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday's close. At current rates, the 50-day can cross over the 200-day on Monday.",

    "selftext": "\nSo, for context, I\u2019m from Spain and almost 30. I started investing around two years ago, when I didn\u2019t really know how it worked. My biggest investment was my current house, which I bought for around 200,000\u20ac, and I\u2019ve also put some money into the stock market sporadically (around 3,000\u20ac total), investing in the classics like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Coca-Cola, by buying individual stocks through Revolut, not funds or ETFs. \n\nI never invested in Tesla, Netflix, and some other companies because they go against my values (Elon Musk, subscription services, gas or arms companies, etc.). But over time, I\u2019ve realized that many of the companies I have invested in don\u2019t align with my morals either, especially after some of them publicly supported Trump (Meta, Amazon, etc.) or Israel (Carrefour, McDonald\u2019s, and many more).\n\nNow I\u2019m dealing with an internal conflict. I want to make money, but not by supporting unethical companies. I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of funds and ETFs also include these companies in different proportions, and the ones that don\u2019t often don\u2019t perform well. So it\u2019s hard to find ways to invest that feel both profitable and principled.\n\nI guess my questions are: how do you align your values with your investments? Do you think there\u2019s a middle ground, and if so, how do you find it? Do you have any recommendations for specific companies, funds, or ETFs that are both ethical and profitable? Or would it make more sense to put the money into a high-yield savings account, crypto, gold, or something else?\n\nAll feedback is welcome.\n",

    "title": "Argument for the P/E ratio new paradigm",
    "selftext": "This is pure intuitive speculation, I will appreciate all corrections and counter arguments! :) \n\n\nCurrent P/E ratios for the US large and ultra-large cap stocks are very high and looking back at history, many people (myself included) wonder if it's still worth it to keep passively investing in them. It appears that the P/E ratios are 'out of balance' and will have to come back down sooner than later. This would supposedly most likely happen by P going down. \n\n\nI am well aware of bubbles, talk of new paradigms, confirmation bias, irrational exuberence and all that good and valid jazz. \n\n\nDespite that, I can't help but feel like there are trends causing inflows of money into assets to increase and compound over time, trends which likely explain recent (decade) huge price increases and will likely continue into the future, further 'skewing' asset valuations and P/E ratios.\n\n\nMore people are buying assets than ever. Demand for assets, return on invesfment is increasing. Rich people get richer, want to spend their money to get richer, and number of rich people is increasing. For example, Amrericans' stock ownership is at an ATH. https://kanebridgenews.com/more-americans-than-ever-own-stocks/\nI suspect a similar picture for the entire world for all asset classes. Demand for assets is increasing faster than supply of assets.*\n\n\nGlobal GDP continues to grow, likely reflecting rising disposable incomes, purchasing power. Due to  diminishing returns' on consumption, more and more people allocate more and more of their disposable income to investments/assets (crude example: once all billionaires get 3 superyachts, most will not want to buy a 4th, instead they will have to put their money somewhere else. Most attractive option for spare money are assetd. There are only so many consumables to go around and the demand for them is not infinite unlike demand for returns on investment aka assets (and blue chip stocks are some of the most attractive assets).\n\n\nShare of incomes going into investments increasing, means share of incomes going into consumption decreases. Consumption roughly is E. Company earnings are not keeping up because people consume fewer and fewer of their products instead opting to put more money into their shares (for example, there is more demand for Tesla shares than Tesla cars, if I may say so). This seems like a very rational decision on the individuals' part and ever reflectd common financial advice.\n\n\nSo, assuming demand for money stays as high as now (likely because humans evolved to want more resources than everyone around them), these trends will continue. Thus we would expect in the long term stock valuations to keep increasing (obviously with short term violatility) even without corresponding increase in their earnings. \n\n\n* For example it's much easier to simply earn money with a job than to create a company providing jobs. Automation. It's easier to earn enough to buy an asset than to build one?\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n\nP.S. apologies for poor writing and any mistakes.",

    "selftext": "Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.\n\nMy position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)\n\nThe Q1 earnings were objectively bad\n\nEPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)\n\nFactory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers\n\nAutomotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s\n\nMusk sounding increasingly distracted on the call\n\nYet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:\n\nThe energy business is quietly becoming a monster\n\nWhile everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvjaujvsra3f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d9767fdce67a01e648d7402b848268abf0ac86c\n\nSource: [https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA](https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA)\n\nThe robotaxi bet could pay off big\n\nI was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.\n\nOptimus robot could be the sleeper hit\n\nThe Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.\n\nI've been wrong before, but...\n\nI sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8p33pme0sa3f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a764dc94eb9b20122126522d0546ca97e49acdd\n\nSource: [https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA](https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA)\n\nThat said, I'm not blind to the risks:\n\nP/E of 171 is insane by traditional metrics\n\nBYD is eating their lunch in China and now Europe\n\nInsider selling has been heavy (Musk, CFO, directors)\n\nThe new affordable model keeps getting delayed\n\nWhat's your take?\n\nAm I crazy for holding through this? Has anyone else noticed the energy business numbers? And what's your read on the robotaxi timeline - real innovation or more Musk hype?",

I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.\n\nAI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.\n\nThese seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.\n\nthe wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.\n\nA lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.\n\nIs the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.\n\nEDIT: I have responded a lot in here, I think that I have clarified a few things with people and would like to change my wording above. Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, it is closer to a pyramid scheme or pump and dump. Not much more to add by responding to new comments, they all seem to be along the same lines.

I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.\n\nMy biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad. I also am a bit worried that the CEO will continue to do more to destroy the Tesla name through other shocking actions.\n\nAny thoughts or advice on which one is should add?",

    "title": "Sold all my Tesla shares before the crash. Here\u2019s why I still think that was the right call (even at today's price)",
    "selftext": "A couple of months ago, prior to Tesla correcting by \\~40% I no longer believed in the thesis of their stock valuation so I sold my entire holdings. Despite my continued admiration for Tesla\u2019s tech, from an investment standpoint, I remain bearish\u2014and it has little to do with the political horizon. Here\u2019s why:\n\n**Robotaxi: A Limited Revenue Catalyst**\n\nTesla plans to launch an unsupervised robotaxi service in Austin by mid-2025. However, even Tesla has admitted these vehicles will require human remote monitoring to ensure safety and regulatory compliance\u2014a reality that adds cost and complexity.\n\nThe U.S. rideshare and taxi market today generates \\~$52 billion annually, projected to grow to \\~$61 billion by 2029. Capturing a meaningful slice of that pie won\u2019t be easy:\n\n* Waymo already operates fully autonomous fleets across Phoenix, San Francisco, LA, and Austin, and is expanding into Atlanta, Washington, Miami, and Tokyo.\n* Pricing will be critical\u2014and Tesla is playing catch-up technologically.\n\nEven if Tesla somehow captured 25% of the entire U.S. market\u2014a wildly optimistic scenario\u2014it would generate \\~$12 billion in revenue and $1\u20131.5 billion in profit over a decade or more.\n\nMore realistically, even under bullish forecasts, Tesla could earn \\~$2 billion in revenue and \\~$200 million in profit from robotaxis by 2029.\n\nCompare that to Tesla\u2019s current \\~$80 billion revenue base.\n\nIt would move the needle by only a few percentage points\u2014and that\u2019s assuming everything goes perfectly.\n\nBottom line: this isn't a market-changing opportunity.\n\n**Optimus: Exciting, But Decades Away From Prime Time**\n\nTesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robot is expected to be priced around $20,000\u2013$30,000. Elon Musk recently suggested a \\~$30,000 target.\n\nAt that price, most consumers would expect meaningful labor-saving ROI within 3\u20135 years. Tasks like:\n\n* Cooking\n* Laundry\n* Grocery management\n* Lawn care and snow removal\n\nHowever, today\u2019s reality? Tesla\u2019s current robots can walk, lift small objects, and wave awkwardly\u2014nowhere near complex, unpredictable home environments.\n\nCritical technical hurdles remain:\n\n* Navigating messy, human-dominated spaces\n* Handling fragile or variable items\n* Making autonomous decisions (e.g., fridge organization, unexpected obstacles)\n\nWithout breakthroughs in sensing and manipulation\u2014well beyond current camera-only perception\u2014it will be years before these tasks are reliably automated. To make matters worse, Tesla is leveraging a camera-only approach versus their competitors who are technologically superior (and not just by a bit, exponentially)\u2014leveraging LiDAR, radar, advanced depth, force and torque sensors, advanced tactile sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Boston Dynamics is easily 5-8+ years ahead of Tesla in this technological space.\n\nFactory deployment of 10,000 Optimus units for repetitive assembly line tasks by year-end? Possible.\n\nHousehold robots folding your laundry? Not this decade.\n\nMusk\u2019s historic promises around autonomy make cautious skepticism wise:\n\n* 2014: \"90% of miles autonomous in 3 years.\"\n* 2016: \"LA to NYC trip without a single touch.\"\n* 2020: \"Level 5 autonomy this year.\"\n\n(Reality, of course, has been less obedient.)\n\nSo, while Optimus could shine in tightly controlled environments, it's unlikely to drive meaningful consumer or enterprise revenue before 2030.\n\n**Tesla's Financial Trajectory: The Red Flags**\n\nTesla\u2019s latest earnings report (Q1 2025) showed:\n\n* 71% drop in net income year-over-year\n* 9% decline in revenue\n* 20% drop in automotive revenue\n* Significant market share erosion in key markets\n\nWithout $595 million in regulatory credits, Tesla would have posted a $189 million net loss this quarter. The underlying trendlines are flashing yellow, if not red.\n\n**Dark Pool Moves: Insider Games?**\n\nSince earnings, Tesla has seen an explosive increase in dark pool trading volume\u2014private institutional trades designed to mask large-scale buying or selling.\n\nCoupled with decreased short interest and bullish options activity, it suggests a manufactured sentiment shift rather than organic investor enthusiasm.\n\nIn plain English: insiders are moving stealthily, likely repositioning ahead of retail reactions.\n\n**Final Take**\n\nGiven the operational, technical, and competitive realities outlined above, I do not believe Tesla will achieve new revenue streams significant enough to materially impact its bottom line within the next 5 to 7 years.\n\nDespite exciting tech demos, neither Robotaxi nor Optimus are poised to materially move Tesla\u2019s bottom line within the next 5\u20137 years. Meanwhile, core auto sales are under pressure, and financial trends are deteriorating. Short-term market maneuvers may cause volatility, but the fundamentals do not justify long-term bullishness at today\u2019s valuations.\n\n**Fact Validation**\n\nI made the decision to fact check myself with ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google) and Grok (X / Twitter). Here's the fact check:\n\nRobotaxi\n\n\\- Tesla has said they will unveil the robotaxi vehicle in August 2024, aiming for service launch by 2025. Confirmed.\n\n\\- Remote monitoring is confirmed (source: Tesla earnings call Q1 2025). Confirmed.\n\n\\- U.S. taxi/rideshare market revenue: \\~$52B in 2024, growing to \\~$61B by 2029 (Statista and IBISWorld confirm this). Confirmed.\n\n\\- Waymo is indeed operational in Phoenix, SF, LA, and Austin, expanding into Atlanta, DC, Miami, and Tokyo (Waymo official updates April 2025). Confirmed.\n\n\\- Your assumption of 25% capture is very generous \u2014 Uber has >70% share vs. Lyft after a decade \u2014 so 25% for Tesla is very ambitious, making your $2B realistic even if optimistic. Confirmed.\n\n\\- Profit margins in rideshare: Uber's net margin is 2\u20135% despite scale. You're right that a \\~$200M profit is realistic at best. Confirmed.\n\nOptimus Robot\n\n\\- Elon has stated $20K\u2013$30K target price range (source: Tesla AI Day, reinforced Q1 2025 call). Confirmed.\n\n\\- Musk acknowledged significant hurdles, particularly in object recognition and manipulation. Confirmed.\n\n\\- Tesla\u2019s robot demos still show very basic tasks (walking, lifting objects), no complex home task automation yet. Confirmed.\n\n\\- Tesla historically overpromised autonomy timelines (you accurately documented Musk's timeline slip-ups \u2014 bravo). Confirmed.\n\n\\- Humanoid robot scaling into assembly line tasks is plausible, household use is years away. Confirmed.\n\nTesla Financials Q1 2025\n\n\\- 71% drop in net income: Confirmed.\n\n\\- 9% revenue decline: Confirmed.\n\n\\- Auto revenue down \\~20%: Confirmed.\n\n\\- $595M regulatory credits: Confirmed. Without them, Tesla would have posted a net loss.\n\nDark Pool Activity\n\n\\- Post-earnings surge in dark pool activity is confirmed (based on trading desk reports and CBOE data). Confirmed.\n\n\\- Dark pools = private institutional trading. It\u2019s correct to infer that sudden surges often signal insider repositioning. Confirmed.\n\n",

    "title": "How China\u2019s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry",
    "selftext": "China\u2019s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.\nThe immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating\u2014starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025\u2014manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.\nCost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared\u2014neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.\nGeopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China\u2019s moves are a response to U.S. tariffs and tech curbs, like the Biden administration\u2019s December 2024 semiconductor export limits. With 90% of heavy rare earths (like dysprosium, critical for EV motor heat resistance) processed in China, a full ban could cripple production timelines. The U.S. has only one active rare earth mine\u2014Mountain Pass in California\u2014producing 15% of global supply, but it lacks sufficient domestic processing capacity. MP Materials, the operator, ships much of its output to China for refining, and its Fort Worth magnet facility won\u2019t be fully online until late 2025 at earliest.\nMitigation efforts are underway but slow. The U.S. is investing in domestic supply chains\u2014Biden\u2019s 2021 Executive Order 14017 and the Inflation Reduction Act pump millions into mining and recycling\u2014but scaling up takes years. Alternatives like Australia (10% of global supply) or Vietnam exist, but their output is dwarfed by China\u2019s, and processing still often routes through Chinese facilities. Recycling could offset 30% of future rare earth demand, yet only 1% is currently recycled in the U.S. Tesla\u2019s shift away from rare earths in next-gen motors is promising, but it\u2019s not yet scalable across the industry.\nThe EV industry faces a triple hit: delayed production, higher costs, and strategic vulnerability. A total graphite ban alone could slash EV output, given China\u2019s 77% share of natural graphite and 95% of synthetic graphite production. Add rare earth curbs, and the U.S. could lose ground in the global EV race, with economic losses estimated at $3.4 billion in GDP from just gallium and germanium restrictions. Without rapid diversification or innovation, China\u2019s restrictions could stall America\u2019s electric dreams.\n",

    "title": "Will the sentiment around Trump & his tariffs affect Tesla\u2019s stock specifically?",
    "selftext": "\\[Update\\]: This got kicked by the Automods and I had a hard time getting it allowed. It\u2019s a little stale now, especially with things changing so fast, but I would still like to have the conversation.\n\nI posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is \"TLDR\" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:\n\nWill the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nFor those looking for something to read, here you go:\n\nObviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain.\n\nHere is a great interview with the well-respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: \"These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)\"\n\nFor those who do not want to watch the whole video, here is the TLDW summary:\n\n1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling \"reciprocal tariffs\".\n\n1. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of \"*somebody out there cracked the code*\". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends.\n\n1. \\*People have been \"numb\" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\\*\n\n1. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.\n\n1. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession.\n\n1. Only \"sycophants\" (maybe we should just call then \"psychopants\" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us).\n\n1. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the \"little guy\" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices.\n\n1. America is a consumer-based economy (\\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is \"no tomorrow\". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.\n\n1. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).\n\n1. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business have very long time-cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.\n\n1. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.\n\n1. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. This will cause more market volatility.\n\n1. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is \"half done\" in his view.\n\nOne thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administration\u2019s haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.\n\nI started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more \"TLDR\" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out as being far more likely to be of great benefit to China in both the near term and long run. Not America.\n\nBack to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a \"possibility\" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:\n\n6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR) (\\*a lot has changed in the three days since I made this chart/post).\n\nWhile the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from its recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the \"Trump Bump\" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and \"meh\" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen any *real* damage to its share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon!\n\nI know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: \"*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*\" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as \"Tesler\". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the \"Elon Reality Distortion Field\" (ERDF).\n\nLet's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised his voters that he would do.\n\n\\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.\n\nFor the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the rosiest picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the \"little people\" of the world (not seeing it myself).\n\nIf there is real and lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers (Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future) boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.\n\nI must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow.\n\nIf there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost (and counting). While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is \"no tomorrow\" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time.\n\nTesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his \"departure\" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla.\n\nThe questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?\n\nFact: [Goldfish have longer memories than previously believed.](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/goldfish-may-have-longer-memories-than-just-three-seconds)\n\n\u00a0",

However, I have been following this stock and honestly: I never had the balls to short it. Seeing how irrational this stock behaved, and how many times short sellers got screwed. Never have I been more convinced a stock is incredibly overvalued though. but I admit I was too chicken.\n\nI think the bubble has bursted and it wil keep dropping from where we are.  \nTesla is the main reason why I am not \"buying the dip\" with ETF's. It's my example/gauge of how the US stock market is still heavily overvalued right now.\n\nNow that earnings, cashflow and margins are in decline, How low do you think it will go?",

    "title": "Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era",
    "selftext": "Elon Musk\u2019s ventures have long dominated \u201cspace investing\u201d conversations \u2013 but with Musk\u2019s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn\u2019t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \\~$10\u201311B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn\u2019t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let\u2019s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:\n\n* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab\u2019s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They\u2019ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \\~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .\n* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab\u2019s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer \u2013 Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn\u2019t waiting around: they\u2019ve signed new launch deals (e.g. an 8-launch contract with Japan\u2019s iQPS just announced) , and they delivered on missions like launching 8 satellites for OroraTech with just 4 months\u2019 turnaround , showcasing operational excellence.\n* Government and Commercial Tailwinds: Unlike many space SPACs and startups that struggled, Rocket Lab has real customers and repeat business. Their backlog is \\~$1.1B , split \\~50/50 between government and commercial clients \u2013 providing diversification. Notably, Rocket Lab was selected for the U.S. Space Force\u2019s NSSL Phase 3 (Lane 1) program , making them eligible for missions under a $5.6B launch contract umbrella alongside incumbents like SpaceX and ULA. They also hold a $515M contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to build missile-tracking satellite systems . These wins not only validate Rocket Lab\u2019s technology in the eyes of key customers, but also ensure a baseline of revenue in coming years. In essence, Rocket Lab is aligning itself as a core player in future government space infrastructure \u2013 a recurring revenue stream that many \u201cnew space\u201d companies lack.\n* Musk Factor \u2013 or Lack Thereof: From an investing standpoint, one could argue that Musk has become a risk factor. Tesla\u2019s own 10-K warned that the brand is tied to Musk\u2019s reputation , and indeed we\u2019ve seen political backlash contribute to Tesla\u2019s sales slump and stock drop . SpaceX, while successful, is privately funded and also influenced by Musk\u2019s persona (which might carry regulatory or public image risks, given his role in government and polarizing public statements). Rocket Lab provides a \u201cMusk-free\u201d exposure to the space sector. CEO Peter Beck is an engineer-executive who keeps a lower profile. There\u2019s no cult of personality driving Rocket Lab\u2019s valuation \u2013 which means less idiosyncratic risk. In fact, Rocket Lab\u2019s shares are more directly correlated with its execution (launch success, contracts, revenue) than with any social media narrative. For an investor, that can be reassuring.\n\nValuation Considerations: After the recent pullback, RKLB trades at a more reasonable multiple relative to its growth. It had skyrocketed over 400% in the past year , but is now off highs. Analysts still see upside: Cantor Fitzgerald recently reaffirmed an Overweight with a $24 target , and other targets range up to $33 . Clearly, expectations are that Rocket Lab will continue to scale and eventually approach profitability as Neutron comes into service. Risks include execution delays (a short-seller argued Neutron could be late to 2026 , which would slow revenue growth) and competition (SpaceX\u2019s dominance, emerging players like Blue Origin). However, Rocket Lab\u2019s head start in small launch and established customer base give it a moat in its niche. Its enterprise value ($11B) is a fraction of SpaceX\u2019s ($140B private valuation), so investors are essentially betting that Rocket Lab can capture even a small slice of SpaceX\u2019s market share in the coming years \u2013 which would justify significant upside.\n\nConclusion: If you\u2019re disillusioned with Musk or simply want a piece of the space sector\u2019s growth, Rocket Lab is one of the most compelling options available. It combines the innovation of New Space with the accountability of a public company. As always, invest based on your due diligence (space is a risky industry), but RKLB offers a balanced risk-reward profile: solid current business, big future bets, and freedom from the Elon factor. For many, that\u2019s an attractive proposition in 2025 and beyond.\n\n",

    "title": "Tariffs & Tesla- Will the hit affect sentiment around Tesla? And are you a goldfish?",
    "selftext": "I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is \"TLDR\" for most people so if you are not into that, just move on. \n\nObviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain. \n\nHere is a great interview with the well respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: \"These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)\"\n\nFor those with short attention spans, here is the TLDW summary:\n\n1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling \"reciprocal tariffs\".\n2. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of \"*somebody out there cracked the code*\". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends. \n3. \\*People have been \"numb\" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\\*  \n4. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.\n5. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession. \n6. Only \"sycophants\" (maybe we should just call then \"psychopants\" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us). \n7. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the \"little guy\" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices. \n8. America is a consumer-based economy (\\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is \"no tomorrow\". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.\n9. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).\n10. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business has very long time cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.\n11. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.\n12. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. \n13. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is \"half done\" in his view. \n\nOne thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administrations haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.\n\n\\*I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more \"TLDR\" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out, as far more likely to be of great benefit China in both the near term and long run. Not America.\n\nBack to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a \"possibility\" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here.

Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his \"departure\" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla. \n\nThe questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?\n\nFact: [Goldfish have longer memories than previously believed. ](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/goldfish-may-have-longer-memories-than-just-three-seconds)",

    "title": "TSLA Fair Value Analysis: The bull The Bear . The case for the 140 and 180 Valuation",
    "selftext": "\n\nTL;DR: Tesla is significantly overvalued at current levels ($240). Fair value range $140-180 based on deteriorating growth metrics, declining margins, and elevated valuation multiples. Current prices require near-perfect execution on unproven future tech bets.\n\n---\n\nI've been watching the Tesla story unfold for years, and recent developments demand a sober reassessment of the stock's fair value. After diving into the latest financials and operational metrics, I believe the market is significantly overestimating Tesla's near-term prospects.\n\nCurrent Market Sentiment vs. Financial Reality\n\nWhile Wall Street maintains an average price target around $310-340, I see a serious disconnect with Tesla's financial performance:\n\nStagnant Growth: 2024 revenue grew a meager 0.95% YoY, with the company posting its first-ever annual delivery decline\nMargin Compression: Q4 operating margin fell to 6.2%, down from 8.2% a year earlier, as Tesla sacrifices profitability for volume\nValuation Stretch: Currently trading at 161x P/E - astronomical even for a growth company, especially one showing signs of maturation\n\nThe Cybertruck Debacle: Canary in the Coal Mine\n\nThe Cybertruck situation isn't just about recalls or insurance challenges - it exposes fundamental issues with Tesla's execution:\n\n* Production challenges with new materials and manufacturing techniques\n* Price points that severely limit market potential (originally pitched as a mass-market vehicle)\n* Sales volumes falling dramatically short of projections (40K annually vs. Musk's 250K target)\n\nWhy $140-180 is Fair Value\n\nA 40-50% downside from current levels might seem extreme, but consider:\n\n1. Rational Multiples: A 50-75x P/E would still be generous for a company with stalled growth and margin pressure. This alone justifies significant contraction.\n\n2. Auto Industry Fundamentals: Legacy automakers typically trade at 5-15x earnings. Even with Tesla's energy business and software potential, a 100% premium to industry leaders feels more appropriate than the current 1000%+ premium.\n\n3. Valuation Models Agree: Discounted cash flow analyses consistently show fair value around $150, with some sophisticated models suggesting even lower targets.\n\n## Profiting From This View\n\nOptions for bulls(No not Caesars legion)  :\n* Reduce position sizes to limit exposure\n* Sell covered calls to generate income while holding core positions\n* Focus on defined-risk options strategies rather than outright stock ownership\n\nFor bears (No not the NCR ):\n* Consider put spreads 6+ months out to avoid short-term volatility\n* Focus on strike prices in the $180-200 range for optimal risk/reward\n\nFor neutral investors(Finally I escape the FNV brain rot ) :\n* Wait for better entry points in the $140-180 range\n* Use cash-secured puts at those levels to potentially acquire shares at even better prices\n\nRisk Factors To My Thesis\n\nI acknowledge several potential upside catalysts:\n\n* The affordable model (expected H1 2025) could exceed volume expectations\n* FSD/robotaxi progress could accelerate more quickly than anticipated\n* Trump administration policies could benefit Tesla's competitiveness\n* Energy storage business could see inflection point in growth/margins\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe market is pricing Tesla as if every ambitious future project will succeed perfectly. History shows that even the most visionary companies encounter delays, setbacks, and execution challenges. A fair valuation needs to account for these risks.\n\nAt $140-180, Tesla would still command a premium valuation that respects its innovation potential while acknowledging the very real headwinds it faces in 2025-2026.\n\n",

During his tenure at Soros Fund Management he brought in over a billion dollars betting on the collapse of the British pound  (Black Wednesday), he also made out like a bandit betting on the collapse of the Yen.\n\nHe started his own investment firm, Key Square Group.  which did so badly they lost a ton of investors until the economic boom under Biden. His firm was very profitable 2021-2023.  The S&P under Biden gave us + 58% or so return or so (corrected).\n\nHe recently said what the Trump stock market tank is just an ordinary cycle, and that had we not prospered so much in 2006, 2007 we would not have had the \"market correction\" of 2008.  2008 was caused by deregulation and bad loans (amongst other things).   He is gaslighting investors and all Americans\n\nHe stands to make a ton of money from an impending recession.\n\nSecretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is an investment banker and worth between 2-4 billion dollars. He is on record saying Trump tariffs are \"worth it\" if they cause a recession. He has also said it's Biden's fault if we have a recession.\n\nBiden oversaw the best economy we have seen in 50 years.\n\nWhat these men have in common is both are bullshitting investors and all Americans.  Egg prices could go to $500 a dozen and they would buy the same amount of eggs they do now and not feel a thing.  They will also profit during a recession and they will be in  a great position to buy anything they want at cheap prices.\n\nNo telling how many White House insiders are shorting the S&P and other funds.\n\nIt's important that investors scrutinize the economy as well as those who are implementing policies that are degrading the market and realize when you are being gaslighted by those will profit from investor ignorance.\n\nFinally, you hear a lot of noise these days with mindless cliches: \"timing the market\" or \"panic selling\" from people who are so gas lit you should avoid smoking around them to avoid combustion.\n\nBuffet is sitting on more cash in the history of BRK and for a reason, and he has clearly said tariffs are not paid by the tooth fairy (they are paid by you and I).\n\nThe best thing an investor can do right now is understand fundamental economics and recognize when you are being gaslighted.  What you are seeing is not a market correction nor an ordinary cycle.  You're witnessing a very healthy market get tanked, and on purpose.\n\nThe irony is the market tries to love Trump.  They love his deregulation, low taxes for the rich and corporations, the end of red tape, etc.  The market loved his election win and we were seeing fresh highs.\n\nUntil he started his trade wars and threats to invade, and annex foreign countries.\n\nFinally, both Trump and Elon have said it's going to be \"painful\" for a \"while\".  It will not be painful for them.  They will feel nothing, Trump has made hundreds of millions in the last few months off of his various grifts, Elon has tanked Tesla with his Nazi antics, but it's not like he's having to go to fewer movies or tighten his budget.\n\nBeware of people telling you about weathering financial hardships from those who profit from them.",

My real fear isn\u2019t a crash\u2014it\u2019s that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.\n\nBonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn\u2019t a market for investors\u2014it\u2019s a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.\n\nIf inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.",

    "selftext": "It\u2019s easy to forget how short the market\u2019s memory is.\n\nStill remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.\n\nGoldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.\n\nMeta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren\u2019t making money. Zuckerberg was \"burning billions\" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google\u2019s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft\u2019s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.\n\nAnd then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.\n\nMeta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.\n\nWhen markets are crashing, it feels like they\u2019ll never go up again. When they\u2019re at all-time highs, it feels like they\u2019ll never go down. Neither is true.\n\nSo investors, it's going to be fine. Just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.",

    "title": "Which companies/funds will be hit hard in next major market downturn?",
    "selftext": "So in every major market downturn a lot of companies are brought down even those that may not be expected. \n\nFor example in the Dot com bubble in addition to tech stocks you had the collapse of Enron and MCI Worldcom. \n\nIn 2008 in addition to bank stocks you had insurance such as AIG, big three automakers, General Electric etc.\n\n2020 you had a lot of retailers that had been struggling for years file for bankruptcy.\n\nHere are my predictions of who/what will be impacted:\n\n*  Crypto - Too many meme coins and speculation. There will be a massive correction due soon not sure if as severe as 2022 but its coming\n* Office Space REITS- some of these have recovered but I don't see their finances improving anytime soon as return to office has been very gradual. Also recent federal cuts will hurt demand especially in suburban office space markets.\n* Meme Stocks in particular Tesla and Game stop. Telsa's PE ratio is way too high and Musk's recent antics have hurt future sales prospects. Gamestop also has way too high of a PE ratio. In a downturn people will turn away and its price will collapse\n* Broadcast /Cable companies - These companies are struggling with cord cutting. In a downturn this will be first thing many consumers cut. Comcast is very vulnerable. Also any regional sports stocks such as MSGE will get hit. \n* Almost every remaining regional retailer that is publicly traded. I'm not sure how many of these are honestly left but any non national retailer that does not have a decent web presence will have a decent chance of not surviving next downturn. \n* AI related stocks. Companies have been spending hundreds of billions for their AI buildout. There will be cuts to AI budgets that not only impact NVDA and AI oriented stocks, but any REITs that own data centers, power companies doing build outs \n* Oil and Gas companies. US production has increase significantly even after blip during pandemic. Due to higher drilling costs in the US expect any dip in oil price to wipe out a lot of producers especially if they are too leveraged in debt. ",

If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.\n\nAnd part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.\n\nAll that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).\n\nEven setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).\n\nOn top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).

    "title": "The Bull Case for\u00a0Xpeng ($XPEV)",
    "selftext": "**Why Xpeng stock ($XPEV) can 5x to hit US$100 (and beyond?) by end-2026**\n\nBelow is a condensed report, drop me a PM if you want to know more. Also, if China stocks are not your thing, either risk-, political-, personal-, or other-wise, kindly ignore. I was not paid or sponsored to write this and do not have glowing EV or AI credentials, but I have been diligently researching and studying the EV industry (including Xpeng) since 2020.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nXpeng is a Chinese EV maker headed by CEO He Xiaopeng, with dual listings in the USA and Hong Kong. Its current price as of today is around US$19.5 with a market capitalization of around US$18.6 billion.\n\nBut is it really just an automaker? I\u2019d argue Xpeng is in fact a software company providing full-stack AI mobility solutions, and seems hugely underestimated by analysts and markets alike. Here\u2019s why Xpeng could see large growth in the coming years, perhaps hitting US$100 by end-2026 (or \\~US$100 billion market cap), using a simple SWOT analysis.\n\n**STRENGTHS**\u00a0\n\n1. **Product & Design:**\u00a0Xpeng\u2019s cars have always had aesthetics in mind, with their latest P7+ and sub-brand MONA M03 sedans\u2019 stylish looks, best-in-class comfort, and large space now huge bestsellers in China. Xpeng is now the 3rd best selling EV carmaker in China at the moment, behind BYD, Wuling, and Geely.\n2. **Affordability:**\u00a0Xpeng cars are kept affordable while retaining many luxury and tech features, providing good value-for-money.\n3. **Cutting-edge Technology & Features:**\u00a0Outstanding Xpeng tech includes an in-house powertrain integrated with the vehicle chassis, plus outstanding autonomous driving capabilities and smart features.\n4. **Strong Leadership Team:**\u00a0In 2023, CEO Xiaopeng and President Wang Fengying overhauled the management team, rooted out corruption, eradicated departmental inefficiencies, and shifted to a more user-centric focus. The CEO remains humble and fully committed to building the company to reach greater heights.\n5. **Strong Supply Chain, Marketing & Branding Management:**\u00a0After a tumultuous 2022 and 2023, Xpeng\u2019s product, marketing, and supply chain teams are now all working harmoniously to swiftly ramp up production and deliver blockbuster hits one after another.\n6. **Financials:**\u00a0The\u00a0[CEO has recently hinted at a\u00a0breakeven quarter this year](https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/07/xpeng-expects-break-even-single-quarter-2025/),\u00a0which will be a pivotal turning point for the company and change in valuation metrics.\n\n**WEAKNESSES**\n\n1. **Low Brand Strength & Perception:**\u00a0Xpeng is slowly but surely growing its reputation in China and overseas, with stronger sales.\n2. **Intense Industry Competition & Price Wars Creating Margin Erosion:**\u00a0Might not necessarily be a weakness since competition breeds innovation and efficiency (see Deepseek). Moreover, Xpeng has several cost advantages, such as Gigapresses and joint raw materials purchases with partner Volkswagen.\n\n**OPPORTUNITIES**\u00a0\n\n1. **Strong 2025 Pipeline:**\u00a02025 official target deliveries is 380\u2013400,000. However looking at their strong pipeline, especially for L3 autonomous driving, I am forecasting 450\u2013500,000 deliveries for this year, with a possibility of attaining 800,000+ EV deliveries for 2026.\n2. **Autonomous Driving (AD) & Self Driving Cars:**\u00a0Xpeng is a strong contender for this race, with the CEO declaring in January 2025 they will achieve Quasi-L3 AD by mid-2025 and Full L3 AD by end of 2025.\n3. **Flying Cars:**\u00a0Xpeng\u2019s Land Aircraft Carrier (modular van and flying eVTOL module) will start deliveries in 2026 (no, this is not a wild going-by-faith projection, the\u00a0[factory is currently under construction with target completion in 3Q 2025](https://cnevpost.com/2024/10/27/xpeng-aeroht-flying-car-base-breaks-ground/)). Their entry will shake up the low-altitude economy due to its mass production capabilities, cost advantages, and synergies with EV production and technology. But don't expect this business to have a huge impact on the stock by itself.\n4. **Humanoid Robots:**\u00a0Xpeng\u2019s bipedal, all-purpose Iron Robots have already been deployed in Xpeng\u2019s factories and stores, and are expected to enter trial commercial use in the second half of 2025, meaning commercial use may come in 2026, including\u00a0**talking and moving like humans.**\u00a0Much potential in this enormous space for Xpeng, which has several differences in its robot tech from its peers (with the CEO just saying he is confident\u00a0[Xpeng will deploy one of the earliest mass-produced L3 robots in China](https://m.weibo.cn/status/5137890441693096)).\n5. **AI Car Chips:**\u00a0Xpeng will mass-produce their potentially game-changing Turing AI chip in mid-2025 (3x the computing power of industry standard Nvidia's Drive Orin-X), where it will set off a chain motion of new product launches. Possible to be adopted by other automakers too. Angus McKenzie from Motortrend has speculated that if Xpeng\u2019s Turing Chip lives up to its full potential, it could be a [Deepseek moment for the car industry](https://www.motortrend.com/news/xpeng-develops-ai-chip-deepseek-moment/).\u00a0\n6. **Robocars & Robotaxis:**\u00a0The final step in autonomous driving (L4/L5 AD), and with endless possibilities: From transportation to food delivery to mobile convenience stores to F&B to ecommerce deliveries. Coupled with Iron Robot can achieve wonders in any industry.\n7. **Global Expansion:**\u00a0Xpeng car sales are accelerating around the world, with a targeted presence in 60 countries by end of 2025, compared to 30 as of end 2024.\n8. **Increasing Partnerships & Institutional Investors:**\u00a0Existing partnerships and investments by Volkswagen may deepen, and institutional investors (domestic or foreign) may start to invest in Xpeng as it becomes recognized worldwide.\n\n**THREATS**\u00a0\n\n1. **Competition:**\u00a0There is always intense\u00a0**price competition**\u00a0in the EV sector, whether in China or overseas. However, Xpeng is in a sweet spot of value for money and product, and will continue to attract customers in the entry-level range.\u00a0**Competition in autonomous driving**\u00a0is fierce, and there\u2019s a chance another car company unlocks L3 and L4 before Xpeng. However, Xpeng will get there eventually too, and it has other prospects, plus it can always catch up and outshine with its robocar offerings. Some may also be worried that\u00a0**copycats**\u00a0will mimic Xpeng\u2019s popular car models bolt for bolt, but it\u2019s not so simple as Xpeng has built up a decade\u2019s worth of proprietary innovation and expertise in building cutting-edge EVs. And will continue to do so.\n2. **Loss of Innovation:**\u00a0Xpeng depends heavily on its tech innovation to stand out. Loss of key men may cause a brain drain and loss of technological edge. Xpeng is tackling this by recruiting the best and brightest, and heavily invested in R&D.\n3. **Geopolitical Tensions:**\u00a0I believe a\u00a0**major war is very unlikely**\u00a0under the current Trump administration. But increasing friction between USA and China may spark another call for\u00a0**delisting of China ADRs**, which if comes to pass will create volatility in the stock prices, but I feel Xpeng\u2019s stock will eventually recover and push higher as the company performs well (will have small forex risk though). USA may also decide to\u00a0**tighten EV chip restrictions**\u00a0on China automakers, but that will not affect Xpeng as it transitions to its own Turing Chip for all its products in mid-2025 (may turn out to be a boon instead as competitors falter).\n4. **Global or Domestic Economic Softness:**\u00a0Any economic slowdown in China or the rest of the world will have a mixed effect on Xpeng\u2019s position as an affordable, mass market, smart EV brand. A slowdown could actually spur more consumers to go for bang-for-their-buck cars, and Xpeng fits the bill perfectly.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nDo you want to own a company that can potentially change the world? Xpeng could turn out to be the\u00a0**Tesla of China, Figure AI of China, Archer Aviation of China, Nvidia of Cars: All rolled into one!**\n\nThe risk reward looks tremendously positive. And the worst case I can see right now is the stock goes sideways due to inexplicable stagnation in its domestic and overseas EV car business, PLUS all its other exciting prospects\u200a\u2014\u200aAutonomous Driving, Flying Cars, AI Chips, Robots, Robocars\u200a\u2014\u200afall flat.\n\nBUT, in a good scenario (not necessarily the best case even), if one or two of Xpeng\u2019s businesses blast off?\u00a0A review of each and my estimated valuations (now and end-2026, with estimated annual sales):\n\n1. **EV Cars (Semi-AD)**\u200a\u2014\u200aCurrent (**L2 AD**, 300K annual sales): US$18 Billion | End 2026 (**L3 AD**, 800K-1M sales + huge/growing orderbook): US$50\u201360 Billion\u00a0*(Benchmarked against BYD & Li Auto valuation)*\n2. **Flying Cars**\u200a\u2014\u200aCurrent (3K orderbook): US$1 Billion | End 2026 (10K sales + 10\u201330K orderbook, depends on type): US$5\u201320 Billion\u00a0*(*[*Benchmarked against Archer Aviation valuation*](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2024/Archer-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Demonstrating-Manufacturing-Certification-and-Commercial-Launch-Momentum/default.aspx)*)*\n3. **Robots**\u200a\u2014\u200aCurrent: Nil | End 2026 (5\u201310K sales + 10\u2013100K orderbook): US$5\u201360 Billion\u00a0*(Wildcard, Enormous potential,*\u00a0[*Benchmarked against Figure AI valuation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/robotics-startup-figure-ai-in-talks-for-new-funding-at-39-5-billion-valuation)*)*\n4. **AI Chips**\u200a\u2014\u200aCurrent: Nil | End 2026 (0\u201320K orderbook + partnerships): US$2\u201320 Billion\u00a0*(Big wildcard at the moment)*\n5. **Robocars (Full-AD)**\u200a\u2014\u200aCurrent: Nil | End 2026 (10\u201350K orderbook + partnerships): US$5\u201340 Billion\u00a0*(Enormous potential,*\u00a0[*Benchmarked against Waymo & Tesla valuation*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-waymo-stock-tesla-robotaxis-29a57e01)\u00a0*with big haircut)*\n\nIs this so ridiculous? Bear in mind Tesla\u2019s sky high valuation for its future autonomous driving, robot, and robocar plays. Now Xpeng is valued at a mere 1.8% of Tesla. A major product breakthrough can trigger a sharp bull run for Xpeng, cause short-sellers to stay away, and maybe turn it into a meme stock. Just my 2 cents. Peace out.",

    "title": "Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?",
    "selftext": "I\u2019m not a Tesla expert, and I\u2019m sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla\u2019s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I\u2019m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of what bothers me:\n\n1. **Elon Musk\u2019s PR Nightmare** \u2013 It\u2019s hard to ignore how much Musk\u2019s public image has deteriorated. Between the \u201cSieg Heil\u201d incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he\u2019s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla\u2019s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.\n\n1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** \u2013 Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that\u2019s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.\n\n1. **Declining Profit Margins** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that\u2019s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.\n\n1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** \u2013 The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla\u2019s next big thing, but it\u2019s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it\u2019s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.\n\n1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** \u2013 Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla\u2019s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla\u2019s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.\n\n1. **Political and Tariff Risks** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there\u2019s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.\n\n1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** \u2013 Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.\n\n1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.\n\n1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** \u2013 Tesla\u2019s alignment with Musk\u2019s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla\u2019s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.\n\nI used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they\u2019re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I\u2019ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",

People realise it's a terrible option, they bounce. Tesla heavy funds (which ones?) start dropping. \n\nMusk, the richest man on earth, borrows money against his valuable stock. If the stock isn't as valuable will he be forced to make his other companies (X, SpaceX etc) public? Obviously he'll never be poor but he would likely do anything and everything to protect his wealth, so what do you think that could entail?",

    "selftext": "China Is Moving On from Tesla  \n  \nTesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to new report from CNBC, Tesla\u2019s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a sales dip, it\u2019s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.\n\nWhile Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla\u2019s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla\u2019s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.\n\nFor years, Tesla thrived under China\u2019s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.\n\nTesla\u2019s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations",

    "title": "Tesla over valued should it be shorted?",
    "selftext": "\nOver the past few years, Tesla\u2019s stock has been propelled by a narrative of future technological breakthroughs and visionary leadership. However, a closer look at the underlying fundamentals\u2014and in particular a comparison with Chinese giant BYD\u2014reveals several concerning points:\n\t\n1.\tSuperior Sales and Market Penetration of BYD\n\t\u2022\tIn 2022, BYD sold approximately 1.86 million new energy vehicles worldwide, compared with Tesla\u2019s 1.31 million deliveries globally (with only about 440,000 delivered in China) [ \ufffc].\n\t\n\u2022\tBYD\u2019s sales figures reflect its diversified product portfolio\u2014from affordable passenger EVs to commercial vehicles and buses\u2014which has allowed it to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding global market.\n\t\n\u2022\tProminent voices like Charlie Munger have even remarked that in China, \u201cBYD is so much ahead of Tesla that it\u2019s almost ridiculous,\u201d noting that while Tesla has been forced to reduce prices repeatedly, BYD has maintained a pricing discipline that reinforces its quality perception [ \ufffc].\n\t\n2.\tIntegrated Vertical Model and Proprietary IP\n\t\u2022\tBYD\u2019s business model is built on deep vertical integration. It manufactures everything from battery cells (including its innovative blade battery) to complete battery packs, ensuring tighter quality control, faster innovation cycles, and cost efficiencies.\n\t\n\u2022\tIn contrast, Tesla\u2019s battery strategy still depends heavily on external suppliers such as CATL, Panasonic, and LG Energy Solution. While Tesla touts its in-house 4680 cell as revolutionary, independent analysis shows that its energy density improvements (in Wh/kg) are modest compared to the rapid progress made by competitors [see discussion below].\n\t\n\u2022\tBYD\u2019s extensive R&D and robust portfolio of patents in battery technology (and its willingness to license technology to other automakers) suggest that its technological edge isn\u2019t just hype\u2014it translates into real, scalable production improvements. Tesla\u2019s reliance on external providers leaves it vulnerable if those suppliers or competing integrated players (like BYD) drive down costs and improve performance.\n\t\n3.\tLimited Technological Differentiation on Core Battery Metrics\n\t\n\u2022\tA key metric for EV performance is energy density (Wh/kg). Despite much fanfare around Tesla\u2019s battery innovations, the improvements in energy density aren\u2019t dramatically superior to those achieved by BYD and other leading manufacturers.\n\t\n\u2022\tThis calls into question whether Tesla\u2019s premium valuation\u2014built largely on future expectations\u2014can be sustained if its core battery technology isn\u2019t materially better. BYD, on the other hand, combines modest improvements in battery performance with a proven, fully integrated production process that has already translated into higher sales volumes and broader market acceptance.\n\t\n4.\tThe Overvaluation Argument and Market Sentiment\n\t\n\u2022\tTesla\u2019s current market valuation appears to be based on an almost irrational optimism about future robotaxis, autonomous driving, and energy storage breakthroughs\u2014none of which have yet materially improved the company\u2019s profitability or production volumes.\n\t\n\u2022\tWith BYD now not only supplying its own vehicles but also securing contracts as a battery supplier for other major players (including recent agreements where BYD\u2019s FinDreams unit is set to supply Tesla\u2019s Shanghai energy storage facility [ \ufffc]), the narrative that Tesla is the sole leader in battery innovation is weakening.\n\t\n\u2022\tWhen you combine lower vehicle sales numbers, an overreliance on third-party suppliers, and only modest improvements in battery performance, the rationale behind Tesla\u2019s high valuation starts to crumble. Investors may eventually reprice Tesla based on its current fundamentals rather than its lofty future projections.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom this perspective, the argument for shorting Tesla centers on the idea that:\n\t\n\u2022\tBYD\u2019s strong global sales, robust vertical integration, and advanced battery IP are not only outpacing Tesla in key markets (especially in China) but also provide a more sustainable competitive advantage.\n\t\n\u2022\tTesla\u2019s reliance on external suppliers and its relatively modest improvements in core battery metrics (like energy density) suggest that its premium valuation is built on an overly optimistic narrative.\n\t\n\u2022\tIf market sentiment shifts away from these future promises and begins to focus on near-term fundamentals, Tesla could see a significant correction.\n\n\nHad gpt organize my info dump in a readable format . But byd is clearly a company that should be valued more it makes no sense that tesla has it\u2019s current valuation. Also throw in global anti American economic sentiment and anti elon well. Seems to make sense that their stock will decline.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-03/tesla-sales-plunge-63-in-france-the-eu-s-second-biggest-ev-market",

    "title": "Third Coast Bancshares: Continued Growth In A Booming Region",
    "selftext": "I have been covering numerous small & mid cap banks for quite some time now and I am bullish on the continued growth of many names. TCBX is based in the high-growth Texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact Texas has more banks than any other state. Here is my analysis on this particular community bank:\n\nHope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company / the future outlook on financials\n\n# Macro Overview:\n\n* **Economic Strength of Texas:**\u00a0Third Coast operates in Texas, whom remain one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. that recently\u00a0[grew at 4.2% in Q3 2024](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)), faster than the nation as a whole. Business friendly policies like no state income tax, have helped corporate relocation's like Tesla, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard. Texas's economy is the\u00a0[eighth-largest](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis))\u00a0when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. Texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor Third Coast.\n* **Impact of Potential Deregulation:**\u00a0[Deregulation is expected to play a pivotal role](https://www.thebanker.com/content/05e97cf7-7d6a-580d-91cb-d27cd4d03092)\u00a0in the new administrations economic agenda. For community banks like Third Coast, this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. With fewer regulatory requirements, Third Coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. Typically, the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. It allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. With deregulation almost certain, focusing on further risk-taking is important. This approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\n* **Presence In A High-Growth Region:**\u00a0Texas has one of the strongest economies in the U.S. consistently outpacing the national GDP growth rate. Third Coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a CAGR of over 25% and EPS growth of over 18% from 2020 to 2024. Deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. This will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. Third Coast's lending increased 9% to $3.97 billion. Urban centers like Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston are hubs for technology, energy, and manufacturing. In particular, residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations, jobs, and incomes.\n* **Current Valuation:**\u00a0Third Coast has a P/E (TTM) of 14.65, slightly below the\u00a0[industry average of 14.8](https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/banks). Yet, the stock has risen over 93% in the last year alone and is just -2.5% from its 52-week high of $37.65. Despite the significant increase, Third Coast is still slightly undervalued. It is significantly under their five-year average high P/E of 16.9. With continued growth expected in the long-term, we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback, or continue holding.\n* **Strong Financial Results:**\u00a0Fierce competition in Texas is intense with hundreds of banks. Nevertheless, Third Coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 IPO. Revenue has increased 80%, EPS 194%, and net income 317%. Profitability metrics like return on average assets, return on average equity, and net profit margin have set new records. They have hit highs of 1.05%, 11.48%, and 27.82%, respectively. Nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7% to 0.58% of total assets. While increases are not desired, the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now.\n\n# Loan Growth & Quality\n\n* **Nonperforming loans:**\u00a0Often, solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. Third Coast predominately lends to CRE and C&I, combined accounting for almost 60% of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by 61.4% to $27.95 million. A large reason for such a major increase stemmed from C&I accounting for over 51% of nonperforming loans. Non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39%. Fortunately, non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans decreased -14% despite their 11.3% weighting.\n* **Nonperforming assets:**\u00a0Unsurprisingly, nonperforming assets increased by 48.7% as a result. Currently, nonperforming assets are only at 0.58% which is still minor for a community bank. We do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. They can easily start to wipe out a bank's equity. Third Coast has grown fantastically, as has nonperforming loans and assets. Both are now at all-time highs for the banks. We will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue.\n\n# Earnings Overview\n\n* **Revenue:**\u00a0Fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16% to $171.38 million. Third Coast benefited from a 15.2% increase in net-interest income due to elevated interest rates. This allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. Floating-rate loans especially boosted interest income, despite rising deposit costs. Total non-interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4% to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue.\n* **Net Income:**\u00a0An impressive increase of 42.7% lead to a total of $47.67 million. This increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income, resulting from loan growth.\n* **EPS:**\u00a0Earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4% to $2.78. Higher revenue, controlled cost management, and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.",

    "title": "The potential AI stocks in 2025",
    "selftext": "When think of AI stocks, the first names that come to my mind is $NVDA and $MSFT. NVIDIA dominates the AI hardware market with its GPU technology, while Microsoft, through its partnership with OpenAI, has become a benchmark in the AI software space.\n\nMeanwhile, Applovin ($APP) has excelled in AI-driven advertising, with its stock price doubling in November, attracting widespread attention. But beyond these giants, there are still many \"hidden champions\" lurking among the small-cap stocks.\n\nFor example, $BBAI, which focuses on defense AI, and UiPath ($PATH), specializing in enterprise automation, have garnered attention from the capital markets due to their deep market positioning.\n\nBut, I am currently eyeing on $BGM's recent stock price fluctuations.\n\nRecently, BGM completed its acquisition of AIFU\u2019s insurance platform, marking a significant step in its transformation into the AI insurance sector. AIFU\u2019s \u201cDuXiaoBao\u201d platform, powered by Baidu\u2019s big data, is a prime example of such integration. It combines Baidu\u2019s 704 million monthly active users with AIFU\u2019s 48 million insurance sales network. Currently, the platform covers over 16.8 million customers and 17.5 million households. With BGM\u2019s integration of medical resources, the user base and insurance coverage are expected to expand significantly, driving explosive growth for the company.\n\nTraditional insurance sales rely on broker networks, but \"DuXiaoBao\" is changing the game by using Baidu and AIFU\u2019s deep data models to offer tailored insurance solutions. In the future, it might even analyze users\u2019 lifestyle and health data to predict their health risks over the next 30 years and design personalized insurance products based on that. Imagine if AI told you there was a 95% chance you\u2019d be sick in the next 20-30 years and recommended an insurance product accordingly\u2014would you buy it? This \u201csmart + privacy\u201d insurance sales model is truly disruptive.\n\nThis approach bears a striking similarity to Tesla\u2019s innovation: Tesla used vehicle data to personalize car insurance, disrupting the traditional auto insurance industry, while BGM is using big data to empower insurance products, revolutionizing the customer experience.\n\nLooking ahead, BGM might even leverage OpenAI\u2019s technology to take the \"DuXiaoBao\" platform global, offering personalized health and insurance services to users worldwide. This vision of globalization and technological integration opens up even greater growth potential for the company.\n\nBGM\u2019s market cap is currently just around $60 million, compared to insurance giants like Prudential (market cap around $21.7 billion) and Prudential Financial (market cap around $46.1 billion), which are dozens of times its size.\n\nThe news page for reference:\u00a0[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bmg-completed-acquisition-high-quality-143000409.html?guccounter=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bmg-completed-acquisition-high-quality-143000409.html?guccounter=1)",

    "title": "Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets",
    "selftext": "**Summary**\n\n* Uber\u2019s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.\n* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.\n* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber\u2019s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.\n* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.\n\n**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**\n\nRecent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google\u2019s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber\u2019s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.\n\nThis situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.\n\nUber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.\n\n**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**\n\nUber\u2019s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.\n\nDiversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google\u2019s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.\n\nFurthermore, Uber\u2019s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber\u2019s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.\n\nUber\u2019s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta\u2019s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.\n\n**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**\n\nThe adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber\u2019s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.\n\nIn addition, overarching trends in urban mobility\u2014including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access\u2014support Uber\u2019s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.\n\n**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber\u2019s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber\u2019s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.\n\nEven under conservative assumptions, Uber\u2019s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%\u2014a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.\n\nUber\u2019s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.\n\n**TLDR:** Uber\u2019s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.\n\n\n\n*Price at Publication:* **$61.13**\n\n  \n",

This move is part of the Pentagon's \"Section 1260H list,\" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.\n\nTencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.\n\nWhile the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.\n\nBoth Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade)",
    "selftext": "**Summary**\n\n* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.\n* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.\n* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla\u2019s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.\n* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.\n* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla\u2019s market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla\u2019s stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.\n\nIn my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla\u2019s slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.\n\nThe most recent data on Tesla\u2019s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla\u2019s streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company\u2019s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla\u2019s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tesla\u2019s stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk\u2019s magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump\u2019s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla\u2019s position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump\u2019s administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.\n\nTesla\u2019s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla\u2019s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla\u2019s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.\n\nTesla\u2019s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock\u2019s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla\u2019s stock has outperformed Nvidia\u2019s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.\n\nAlthough Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company\u2019s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.\n\nIn conclusion, Tesla\u2019s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company\u2019s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock\u2019s near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla\u2019s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.\n\n",

    "title": "Bitcoin Isn\u2019t Unique But Infinite\u2014$100K Is Beyond Absurd",
    "selftext": "Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it\u2019s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, \u201cOnly 21 million bottles will ever exist.\u201d They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn\u2019t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it\u2019s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.\n\nThink about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system\u2014one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants\u2014to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing\u2014they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin\u2019s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.\n\nThis brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.\n\nStocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.\n\nFiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers\u2014companies, governments, or individuals\u2014to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.\n\nCryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing\u2014no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, \u201cWe\u2019re only producing 21 million bottles.\u201d The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.\n\nThe absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price doesn\u2019t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin\u2019s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin\u2019s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren\u2019t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they\u2019re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.\n\nThis speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin\u2019s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It\u2019s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.\n\nWhen the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin\u2019s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",

I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.\n\nHere is how I divvy my money:\n\nStock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment\n:--|:--:|--:\nS&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%\nNASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%\nMAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%\nSmall Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%\nBitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%\nFinancial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%\nSemiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%\nIndividual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%\n**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%\n\n*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.\n\n**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)\n\n---\n\nI think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.\n\nI'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).\n\nPlease provide any thoughts or constructive criticism below. Thank you",

It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. \n\nThe Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). \n\nBut only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. \n\nIf they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.' \n\nGod bless traders and investors.",

    "title": "Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes",
    "selftext": "I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.\n\nI\u2019m going to blow your minds a little bit.\u00a0\n\nAlmost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit.\u00a0\n\nMost investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price.\u00a0\n\nThe use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc.\u00a0\n\n**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990\u2019s. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high! Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you (an old investor) made a profit by selling to a new investor?\n\nI really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes, you can stop reading here, because I don\u2019t think anything I\u2019m going to say beyond this point is going to help you.\n\nThe next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non-dividend (which is the vast majority) stocks, derivatives, physical collectibles like pet rocks/beanie babies/tulip bulbs, and digital collectibles like in-game skins/NFTs/cryptocurrencies, etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks, direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you, or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time, the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason, and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future.\n\nSo, what is a Ponzi? According to ChatGPT, a Ponzi scheme is \u201ca fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually, the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time.\u201d\n\nThat seems like a pretty good definition to me! The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part: \u201cthe scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.\u201d This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example, yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high.\u00a0\n\nThe part that is extremely important, in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors, is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi-like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn, and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal, because if you aren\u2019t able to essentially over deliver (and underpromise) on future returns to even things out, you\u2019re essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money, turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you\u2019re able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi-loop I described.\u00a0\n\nAnother attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi\u2019s almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money, it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets.\u00a0\n\n**Example 2.** Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1,000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10% annual yield so that in 1 year\u2019s time, any of the original investors can withdraw $1,100, if they so please. Unfortunately, our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi, and after 1 year, obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11,000, but he only has $10,000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him, Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now, and the tickets incidentally cost $1,100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back ($1,100 x 9 = $9,900). When the 10th person comes back, he realizes there\u2019s only $100 for him, not the $1,100 he was promised! The fund not only has basically no money left, it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police, and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud.\u00a0\n\nI will note that in this example, this scheme required 90% of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse, but examples in history tend to be much more skewed, where even a small withdrawal of 1-5% of investors can completely collapse the scheme.\n\nReturning to the investable object definition, once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors, the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects (that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for) actually had a negative cash balance the entire time! Behind the curtain, there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10,000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame, and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day, there are two truths: you still own the investable object aka the charizard, and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out, hoping that people become interested in charizards (and Pokemon) again.\u00a0\n\nI hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non-Ponzi investable objects being echo-chambered as Ponzi\u2019s on Reddit, when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object, or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market, and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics, it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return, it also probably isn\u2019t a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this.\u00a0\n\n**Example 3.** Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi (trades on open market) nor a scam (they actually sell cars, batteries, etc for a profit). It might be a bubble if you think the company\u2019s market cap is too high for what its future profits will be.\n\n**Example 4.** Nikola stock is not a Ponzi (stock traded on open market), but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were (they weren\u2019t), and how many they sold (pretty much zero).",

    "title": "Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money",
    "selftext": "I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.\n\nTime and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.\n\nYet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?\n\nAt the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.\n\nSo let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam \"price targets\" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks \"uninvestible\" if that makes you trade.",

This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*\n\nI did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. \n\n**Investment strategy:**\n\n1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  \n2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  \n3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  \n4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*\n\nI think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.\n\n**Looking forward:**\n\nSince Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!\n\nMy next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think?

The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.\n\n>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \\~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn\u2019t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it\u2019s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what\u2019s coming thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA (moat), among\u00a0[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).\u201d\n\n>\\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023\n\n# Nvidia's dominance\n\nI'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:\n\n* Nvidia is\u00a0[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)\u00a0and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.\n* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.\n* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.\n* AI will consistently make software\u00a0easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).\n* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.\n\n# We still underestimate the AI opportunity\n\nMost importantly, we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of AI\u2019s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.\n\nWe have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nI'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)\u00a0I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I\u2019m still benefiting from.\n\nI expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \\~24% and \\~16%.",

    "title": "Returning to active stock portfolio management",
    "selftext": "I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I\u2019ve adopted.\n\nBut first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.\n\nWhen I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.\n\nIn 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because \u201ceveryone\u201d said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn\u2019t trading rationally. I\u2019d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.\n\nAlthough I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn\u2019t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin\u2019s decline, PaySafe\u2019s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.\n\nThe arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.\n\nWhen I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn\u2019t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.\n\nNow, I feel I\u2019ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. \n\nTo avoid repeating the same mistakes, I\u2019ve set specific rules to guide me:\n\n1. I Avoid Speculative Investments\nI now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  \n\n2. I Reject Market Timing\nI no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to \u201cbuy low today and sell high tomorrow\u201d because it\u2019s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn\u2019t pay off.\n\n3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity\nIn the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.\n\n4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure\nI cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just \u201cokay\u201d rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.\n\n5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value\nMy approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.\n\nI hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",

    "title": "I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.",
    "selftext": "Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. \n\nThese are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. \n\n1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.\n\n  \n2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new \"DOGE\" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.\n\n  \n3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there \"Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth\".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. \n\nVW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. \n\n  \n4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.\n\n  \n5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. \n\nin 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.\n\n  \nI think Rivian makes a fantastic product, and there's a bright future ahead for them.",

    "selftext": "Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. \n\nWarren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto \"invest in things you understand\" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.\n\nAs most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).\n\nTesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it \"ate it's own cake too\" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nGod bless us Signal vs. Noise Investor Masterace (that's all of the good folks on r/Investing)",

Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.\n\nBut I really feel like it is so risky to invest in the stock.

But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.\n\nHaving said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n  \nGod bless Signal vs. Noise",

    "selftext": "My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.\n\nThe knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the \"other stuff\" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their \"AI hardware\" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \\*literally\\* the same thing.\n\nThey didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.\n\nThis came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.\n\nAs to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.\n\nBefore all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.\n\nI don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.\n\n  \ntl,dr; the energy it takes to train ChatGPT could fry 100,000 turkeys this year (I didn't check the math)",

Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.\n\nI feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?\n\nFWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.\n\nBut it would go something like this\n\n- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).\n\n- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.\n\n- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.\n\n- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.\n\n- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. \n\nWith each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. \n\nIts not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.\n\nBut stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream 'good ideas' to buy for uninformed investors. However Tesla has had both dips and peaks since it lowered from its peak.",

    "title": "Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI Era",
    "selftext": "Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.\n\nThanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.\n\n**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**\n\nAccording to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.\n\nConsidering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.\n\nSpecifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).\n\nThe Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.\n\n**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**\n\nBoth NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.\n\nTesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, \"As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.\"",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I\u2019ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.\n\nSo I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. \n\nMy question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it\u2019s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else. \n\nJust want to hear your thoughts because I\u2019m still young and haven\u2019t been around too long in the market.

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    \n\nA little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I\u2019ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  \n\nMy total cost basis is $34k and I\u2019m sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  \n\nI still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I\u2019m a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn\u2019t be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I\u2019m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  \n\nAnyways, just want to share this with someone since I can\u2019t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It\u2019s anyone\u2019s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can\u2019t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I\u2019ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.\n\nI'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?\n\nAlso, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?\n\n  \nEdit: On a scale of 1 (Rather Questionable) to 10 (Boldfaced Securities Fraud), how would you rank this situation?

Insight\u00a0\n2. Conviction\u00a0\n3. Patience\n\n**Insight**\n\nI\u2019ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).\u00a0\n\nBen Graham\u2019s quote rings true:\u00a0\n\n>\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, I\u2019ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.\u00a0\n\nFinancials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.\u00a0\n\n# Math\n\nIn 2023 I also started\u00a0practicing math daily\u00a0(243 days straight\u00a0as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I\u2019d done any meaningful math.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much, but it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.\u00a0\n\n**Conviction**\n\nA big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.\u00a0\n\nHowever, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.\u00a0\n\nConviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I\u2019ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I\u2019m happy I did.\u00a0\n\nA big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.\u00a0\n\nThis is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,\u00a0you must seize them.\n\n**Patience**\n\nAs a result of my convictions, I\u2019m much more patient in my investing these days and don\u2019t react to the day-to-day.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I don\u2019t make another trade for the rest of 2024.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nA commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:\n\nI opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \\~28% (\\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \\~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",

How should we approach fundamentally, with companies that are literally creating the market (Apple back in the day, AirBnB, Coinbase, Tesla)? Or, rapidly expanding the market (NVIDIA with ai chips, energy companies that are investing in nuclear power plants). \n\u2014\nIn mature companies, it\u2019s easy for us to value invest. But, growth investing..? I tried finding some things online but no luck yet.\n\u2014\nI am assuming that the investor really needs to know the market in which the growth is happening to truly evaluate the potential of the company. For example. If someone works in the energy industry, and understand the high energy demand of data centers, and also understands how nuclear can provide such demand\u2014then I guess that would be it. But for an outsider, how should one go about it? ",

    "title": "Car EV rental experience with Sixt",
    "selftext": "Hi all, I was looking for some information regarding this very topic a few weeks ago before I embarked upon the rental of an EV with Sixt. Thought I\u2019d share our recent experience.\n\nI rented a Tesla Model Y for 5 days from / to Brisbane airport. I found any rental site out of the airport (in the city area) to have less and more expensive car options. I like how EVs drive, so I picked that; but there were many options to choose from at the airport station.\n\nSome details of my rental:\nTravelled as a group of 4 from Brisbane airport to Gold coast and Byron Bay, then back. \n\nOriginally booked a BYD ATTO 3 but changed it to a Tesla Model Y at the last minute as I found it much more spacious. \n\nCharged at various locations including Chargefox DC chargers, AC chargers and Tesla superchargers. \nI found many posts online and a YouTube video which stated that both Chargefox and Tesla chargers are free. I can confirm that the Chargefox RFID they provided did work with no issues, so Chargefox charging was free, but it certainly was easier to find a Tesla supercharger at various points along our route. \nOne of the staff at the rental station mentioned Tesla chargers are free as well, but the other then said it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve still yet to find out for myself - will post back at some point about this.\n\nThere are Toll motorways in / around the airport area, and we crossed them when exiting the airport and when heading back. They save you about 30 minutes each way, so I\u2019d recommend taking them. The charges are paid for by Sixt first, before they slap on a daily admin fee on top and charge it to your credit card. I was told it comes up to approx 10 AUD each way. Again, yet to find out at this stage but seems reasonable. \n\nI had an issue with Sixt trying to reverse the charges of the ATTO 3 which I originally booked, as I had upgraded to the Tesla at the time, but they promise it would be a complete refund and that it should all go through soon. Overall, they seemed OK for a rental company. \n\nThere certainly were positives and negatives when renting an EV whilst on holiday, some pretty obvious. One of the main downsides was the stress of ensuring we always have sufficient charge. The main upside was EVs drive great with lots of tech and safety features. Made me feel safe when on the motorways and it was super convenient to have reliable auto steer for the 1-2 hour road trips. \n\nWould I do it again though? Probably not, especially when travelling as a group which can be a bit tricky to plan around. It\u2019s more convenient to hire a petrol/hybrid, which can also be plenty great on mileage. However, if you are interested to try an EV whilst on a holiday in Brisbane (and maybe even travelling solo or as a couple), it\u2019s possibly slightly inconvenient but certainly doable! Sixt seems to be a good option to do this, compared to some of the other companies. It wasn\u2019t clear if Hertz still provides free EVIE charging for their Polestar fleet but I found an article that stated they don\u2019t do so anymore. We managed to get topped up along the way by planning early using the ABRP and Tesla apps which are awesome and very very accurate. The longest we ever had to wait for a DC charger was 20 minutes and that\u2019s only because the car owner was unapologetically irresponsible and returned late to his vehicle.\n\nGood luck on your rental! Happy to answer any questions if there\u2019s any! \n",

That's all anecdotal, of course.\n\nThen there's the constant news of automakers scaling down plans for new models or EV battery works. And obviously the current federal government doing pretty much everything it can to shiv the EV market in general. Though sometimes I have to remember that this administration, too, shall pass.

    "selftext": "I've just completed towing a motorcycle 1,700 miles in each vehicle, ICE vs EV.\n\n2018 Model 3 Long Range vs 2005 Toyota Highlander V6. Both have 205k miles on them. Towing a 4x8 trailer with no vertical gate with a 620lb motorcycle on it.\n\n19mpg at $2.90/gallon vs 3.1mi/kWh at $0.35/kWh is $259 gas vs $191 charging to drive 1,700 miles. If you were using expensive non-tesla charging, it'd be $296 in charging at $0.54/kWh.\n\n3h30min spent on charging/bathroom/food stops(including driving to and from the charger). 17 stops, each of which were charge stops. My charges were typically 5%-55% to maximize my charge curve. We stopped when the car needed a charge, and peed while we were at it.\n\n1hr50min spent on 8 gas/bathroom/food stops. We stopped when we had to pee, and filled gas while we were at it. The inverse of the EV way of doing things.\n\nUnhooked the trailer at charging stations 6 out of 17 times. Unhooked at gas pumps zero times.\n\nGot soaked at an EV charger twice while plugging in. Got soaked at a gas pump zero times.\n\n\nMy experience is that the minimal cost savings is not worth the hassle of long distance EV towing, even at a decent 3.1mi/kWh efficiency. In a non-tesla, you'd likely spend more on charging than on gas. Combine that with trailer-unfriendly charge stations, uncovered charge stations, and frequency of stops, and ICE still reigns supreme for towing long distance. Autopilot was very nice, though.",

And when this happens, do you wait? If so how long? Or go somewhere else?\n* Basically the same question for overnight hotel charging.

    "selftext": "Hey electrons,\n\n**Here are all (\\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in May 2025,**\u00a0according to the US Department of Energy. You can\u00a0[get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).\n\nThese chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:\n\n1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.\n2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in\u00a0r/leaf.\n\n**Some of these chargepoints will be \"refreshes,\"**\u00a0e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.\n\n**There were 311 CCS charging stations with a total of 943 chargepoints added or refreshed in May 2025.**\u00a0For comparison, there were 223 new CCS charging stations in May 2024, with 534 chargepoints.\n\nThis month saw an increase relative to May of last year, and was very similar to last month.  Looking at the data, I cast side-eye on a few of the largest numbers, but overall it looks plausible.\n\nNote that several of these are Tesla Superchargers with Magic Dock. This has a significant influence especially on the number of total chargepoints.\n\n**NOTE:**\u00a0most Tesla Superchargers still do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (but any that are shown in this report should have it). I recommend using the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.\u00a0**Be aware some older stations with Magic Dock still have short cords,**\u00a0which require most CCS vehicles to block two chargers. Newly listed ones here probably have long cords, but you might want to test them out when it's not Christmas Eve.\n\n**(\\*) \"What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?\"**\n\nTesla has said they will allow cars from participating automakers to charge at v3 and newer Superchargers without Magic Dock. Since then the rollout has been gradual. Today Ford, Rivian, Hyundai, GM, Rivian, Nissan, and Polestar owners can order adapters from the manufacturer of their vehicle.\u00a0[Others are coming soon.](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/tesla-superchargers-open-to-other-evs-what-to-know-a9262067544/#:~:text=BMW%2C%20Mini%2C%20and%20Rolls%2D,Tesla%20Superchargers%20that%20same%20year)\n\nHowever, since non-magic-dock superchargers are open to only\u00a0*some*\u00a0CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, both those that support\u00a0*all*\u00a0CCS vehicles and those that only support the manufacturers currently permitted to use an adapter.\n\n**\"What about non-Tesla EVs with a built-in NACS port? Can they use all superchargers?\"**\n\nSo far there is only one sold in volume: the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. Even with a built-in NACS port, it can only use newer superchargers (generation 3 or better). However,\u00a0[even with this car you may have to block two stalls at Gen 3 stations with short cords,\u00a0](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/23/hyundais-new-tesla-charging-port-comes-up-short/)so for now it's not significantly better than using a NACS adapter and you will need a CCS adapter for other stations.\n\n**\"Will the AFDC data continue to be available?\"**\n\nSo far, DOGE cuts don't seem to have affected the source data for this report.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nTo streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.\n\nFor serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.\n\nIf you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can\u00a0[sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.\n\n    \u27a1 AB\n    \n    (2) PETRO-CANADA 37764 - 1\n    1010 Strathcona Drive Southwest\n    Calgary, AB T3H 2Z8\n    \n    \u27a1 AL\n    \n    (2) Long Lewis Ford of Hoover\n    2551 AL-150\n    Hoover, AL 35244\n    \n    (2) Long-Lewis Chevrolet\n    118 Woodward Ave\n    Muscle Shoals, AL 35674\n    \n    (2) Long Lewis Ford of the River Region\n    2091 Fairview Ave\n    Prattville, AL 36066\n    \n    \u27a1 AR\n    \n    (4) Mark Martin Ford\n    1601 Batesville Blvd\n    Batesville, AR 72501\n    \n    (4) Everett Ford\n    19723 I-30 Frontage Rd\n    Benton, AR 72019\n    \n    (2) Harry Robinson Buick-GMC\n    6000 SOUTH 36TH STREET\n    FORT SMITH, AR 72908\n    \n    (4) Newport Chamber of Commerce Parking Lot\n    209 Hazel St\n    Newport, AR 72112\n    \n    \u27a1 AZ\n    \n    (4) Jones Ford Casa Grande\n    2425 E Florence Blvd\n    Casa Grande, AZ 85194\n    \n    (4) Fast Market Shell - Gilbert\n    1655 E Queen Creek Rd\n    Gilbert, AZ 85297\n    \n    (4) Findlay Hyundai Prescott\n    3250 Willow Creek Road\n    Prescott, AZ 86301\n    \n    (1) SV_COLONIA SIERRA VISTA L3\n    102 Colonia De Salud\n    Sierra Vista, AZ 85635\n    \n    (2) GPM INVESTMENTS 4615 DC1\n    9520 E 22nd St\n    Tucson, AZ 85748\n    \n    \u27a1 BC\n    \n    (2) MARINE CHRYSLER LINK L3\n    450 Southeast Marine Drive\n    Vancouver, BC V5X 4V2\n    \n    (4) 2323 W Broadway\n    2305 W Broadway\n    Vancouver, BC V6K 2E6\n    \n    \u27a1 CA\n    \n    (2) Serfas Service Station\n    800 Serfas Club Drive\n    Corona, CA 92882\n    \n    (2) ORANGE COAST EXPP-SERVICE-1\n    2925 Harbor Blvd\n    Costa Mesa, CA 92626\n    \n    (3) 7Charge - Eastvale 41989\n    12578 Schleismann Rd\n    Eastvale, CA 92880\n    \n    (6) Holiday Inn Express Sacramento\n    9175 W Stockton Blvd\n    Elk Grove, CA 95758\n    \n    (8) Fallbrook Plaza\n    1055 S Main Ave\n    Fallbrook, CA 92028\n    \n    (4) Loop Neighborhood Market\n    5515 Auto Mall Pkwy\n    Fremont, CA 94538\n    \n    (4) Double Tree by Hilton Livermore\n    720 Las Flores Rd\n    Livermore, CA 94551\n    \n    (1) MB CUST PARKING MB SECOND FLOOR\n    1801 South Figueroa Street\n    Los Angeles, CA 90015\n    \n    (2) Chevron - Modesto\n    815 Kansas Ave\n    Modesto, CA 95351\n    \n    (5) City of Pasadena - Robinson Park\n    1081 N Fair Oaks Ave\n    Pasadena, CA 91103\n    \n    (3) City of Pasadena - Victory Park\n    2575 Paloma St\n    Pasadena, CA 91107\n    \n    (6) Salinas Shopping Center\n    1140 S.

    "selftext": "I've seen a lot of reviews of the Equinox EV and cannot really tell if it was designed to be an EV.   Some say yes, some don't say.  None mention a frunk or a flat rear floor.\n\nI had a chance to look under the hood of a 2024 Equinox EV and it looks suspiciously like a gas engine compartment with the front electric motor dropped in.   Nobody in my area has a 2025 that I can check.\n\nI'm concerned about EVs that are mere adaptions of gas vehicles.  I drove a Hyundai Kona EV a few years ago and it was obvious that many artifacts of the ice drivetrain were present, e.g. the missing gasoline fill tube takes up room in the back as does the non-existent muffler, no frunk and a hump under the rear seat.\n\n**Edit: here's what I learned.   Thanks all!**\n\n* The fact that the ice and EV models share the Equinox name is inconsequential.   The Equinox EV is a ground up EV design based on the Ultium platform.\n* The rather large empty space I observed under the hood in front of the drive motor/inverter, roughly 0.25m or so all the way down, on a 2024 Equinox EV is not space that an ice engine radiator would go.\n* If you Google for information for Ultium (as some commenters helpfully suggested) the headlines say that GM is dropping it.  Drilling into it: GM is not dropping Ultium just changing the name.  Now, GM refers to it as the BEV3 platform.\n* The speed for DC charging tops out at 150kW, which to me is slow for something designed in this decade.\n\nLet's see, is that it?   Oh yeah, one more thing...\n\n* Mentioning that you find the frunk in a Tesla useful elicits strong opinions from some people.",

    "selftext": "I spent two nights camping in my Tesla Model Y in the UK with the Tentsla tent. It was a great experience, being able to switch the heating on to beat the chill in the morning was amazing. We managed to get a flat bed by removing the rear bench despite some people saying that it does not make a difference.   \n  \nI created a short review that I can share in a DM. However, the equipment list with a bit of information is here: \n\n\\- Tentsla Tent [https://tentsla.com](https://tentsla.com) it seems to be the best option for a Model Y tent. If my children were older or even I did not have children I would have opted for a roof tent, but this is great to keep everyone on the same level. Be careful not to over inflate the supports, this is where most people go wrong with these tents.  \n  \n\\- Tesla mattress [https://shop.tesla.com/en\\_gb/product/model-y-air-mattress](https://shop.tesla.com/en_gb/product/model-y-air-mattress) this was great, very easy to inflate with the provided electric pump, fits perfectly, is quite hard but very supportive. Make sure to also deflate it with the pump to suck all the air out. Make sure to remove the rear bench to get the 100% flat platform with the seats down. I wanted to avoid this but actually it is amazingly easy to do and it makes a big difference.  \n  \n\\- Alpicool K18 fridge, review here: https://youtu.be/iVNR264pc-A. Amazing, but it needs a longer 12v extension cable to be able to put it in the frunk while being plugged into the central console 12v outlet.  \n  \n\\- Window blinds something like this: [https://amzn.eu/d/4mIs4Un](https://amzn.eu/d/4mIs4Un)  \n  \n\\- Table with storage under it [https://amzn.eu/d/amSJVpT](https://amzn.eu/d/amSJVpT) this was great for storing things in.  \n  \n\\- Tablet or Nintendo switch mount attached to the glass ceiling: [https://amzn.eu/d/gcVY5d9](https://amzn.eu/d/gcVY5d9)  \n  \n  \n",

    "title": "Cadillac Vistiq second review left me with mixed feelings",
    "selftext": "I posted a favorable impression from a brief demo drive of the 2026 Cadillac Vistiq a few weeks back.  My overall conclusion was that it was probably the leading candidate among the 3 row EV's to replace our aging BMW X5.\n\nFollowing that brief drive, the dealership offered us an overnight demonstration, which we took advantage of and drove the vehicle quite extensively.  This second, longer look left me with mixed feelings.  Here is my take, to the extent it helps others in their process:\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Great format & size - similar in height, width and weight to our current BMW X5, though slightly longer for the occasional use third row.  Still shorter than most full-size pickups and fit into our garage quite well.\n2. Styling looks great in an Escalade, American luxury, Cadillac way.\n3. 615HP is super strong and welcome.\n4. Interior design is beautiful.\n5. The Captain\u2019s chairs are great - every 3 row SUV should have a captain\u2019s chair option.\n6. The very rare sunroof that actually opens in an EV also manages the wind buffeting quite well.\n7. Supercruise for the mapped roads now comes with lane keeping assist for the unmapped ones, and apparently that is new for the GM super cruise vehicles.\n\nOpportunities for improvement:\n\n1. Some of the interior plastics are low grade - the cupholder area, the dash plastics intended to look metal but don\u2019t quite get there, and the lower door panels and 3rd row area are covered in the cheapest of plastics.\u00a0 Definitely not at the level of a similarly priced BMW X5.\n2. There were two areas of plastics already buzzing and rattling in this example with 278 miles on the odometer - one at the windshield which I believe was the big plastic cover behind the mirror, and another one in the cupholder area that I couldn\u2019t figure out which piece it was despite my wife and I both trying.\n3. Playing the sound system at moderate volumes made some interior plastics buzz, which is not fun if you\u2019re a music listener.\u00a0 You can turn it up further to drown out the plastic buzzing, but if that\u2019s not what you wanted or if you have passengers, then it\u2019s a bummer.\n4. AKG sound system doesn\u2019t astonish as the marketing would have you believe.\u00a0 Above average is all I would say.\u00a0 I was surprised how shallow it made L+R sources sound (which remains much of available content these days) and there was very little from the surround speakers or immersive processing happening.\u00a0 The bass could be muddy depending on the song, not to mention how it made the plastics buzz.\n5. The Tour suspension setting repeatedly made my wife motion sick - too wallowy especially when on the state routes & secondary roads.\u00a0 Sport setting was OK for us.\n6. A truly stupid engineering mistake with the 3rd row headrest release point prevents the third row power seat from folding as intended.\u00a0 Just release the headrests at the moment you push the buttons, rather than releasing them two-thirds of the way into the folding travel, where they have already stopped the seats from folding because they hit the second row seatbacks.  Dumb and easily remedied.\n7. Too many bings and bongs going on, which I found annoying many times, but especially at the frequent and sudden endings of a mapped Supercruise roads. Rather than just switching to ACC + Lane Keeping it goes into a meltdown.\u00a0 And why does it bong at every lane change?  How passengers would ever sleep in this vehicle is a mystery.\u00a0\n8. It lit up my garage all night long while charging.\u00a0 My garage has windows facing the front of my house - I bet my neighbors were wondering what the heck was going on all night.\u00a0 Though I looked, I did not see a way to turn the charging headlights and taillights off.\n9. I found no way to turn off the annoying and fake acceleration sounds.  If you already own a Tesla or other EV, perhaps you're like me that you've grown to appreciate the silence.  At least give the option for off.\n10. I had to use an adapter to charge on my existing wall charger.  We are keeping our current EV and I'm not sure I like the idea of forever using an adapter - I wish it had NACS already.\n\nSo I'm torn.  I thought this was going to be the one, and maybe we will ultimately overcome our concerns, but we are going to hold off for now.",

    "title": "PSA: Tesla has replaced Idle Fees with Congestion Fees at all North America superchargers. This affects anyone who uses their network, Tesla or not.",
    "selftext": "For those of you unfamiliar with congestion fees they more or less operate as idle fees with two key differences.\n\n\n\n1. Instead of applying 5 minutes after the end of your charging session it applies 5 minutes once your car has reached 80% displayed state of charge (or when your charging session ends if your charge limit is below 80%)\n\n2. Instead of applying 50 cents per minute at 50% capacity and $1 per minute at 100% capacity congestion fees apply at a flat rate of 50 cents/minute at an undisclosed supercharger capacity stated by Tesla as \"when busy\" \\[in their FAQ\\](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/supercharger/fees) and when \"close to full\" by \\[the Tesla Charging Twitter account\\](https://x.com/TeslaCharging/status/1928609011013652780).\n\n\n\nIn my opinion this is a truly awful change. I did not oppose congestion fees at select chargers that experience unusually high capacity as almost all people using them were residential chargers and could afford to only charge to 80%. However, I personally road trip quite often and have experienced circumstances where I needed to charge past 80% displayed SOC with high capacity many times. On top of this Tesla refusing to disclose explicit thresholds of capacity gives them the right to charge these fees basically whenever they feel like it. I am extremely disappointed in Teslas failure to define clear thresholds for people to follow when they need to.",

The reason for this is because the brake pedal was directly linked to the brake pads and so a reduced Regen setup would never use the vehicles \"max Regen\" abilities.\n\nIn the new Model Y, it's brake by wire, so the first inch can be Regen only when using a reduced Regen setting.\n\nDo any other cars have this ability?",

What I haven't been able to figure out is, how common it is for EV drivers to carry an adapter cable with them to ensure that they are good to go wherever the park to charge.

EVGo, Electrify America, and Ionna's 350's will make the most of it. \n\n> In the new era, EV drivers also need to understand how much voltage a fast-charging station can deliver\u2014a number that isn\u2019t widely advertised by charging providers. Tesla's newest V4 Superchargers, which are fed by older V3 power cabinets, can only output up to 500 volts, while every other 350-kW charger can deliver 1,000 volts.  \n\n>The 2025 Ioniq 5\u2019s larger battery pack operates at 697 volts (though it\u2019s often referred to as an 800-volt electrical architecture), and one of the principles of charging a battery is that the power input needs to be higher than the pack voltage or else the electricity moves in the wrong direction: out of the battery pack.\n\n> Give it time, and this confusion should\u2014hopefully\u2014fix itself. Tesla has announced that 1,000-volt Superchargers are coming to North America this year, but the timeline for when and how quickly they\u2019ll roll out is as certain as any other timeline the company has ever indicated. Other charging providers such as EVgo and Ionna are also opening new dispensers with NACS connectors that can hit 1,000 volts. \n\n",

    "selftext": "By: Laurence Iliff June 04, 2025 04:00 AM\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk mocked traditional American pickups for their stale design and combustion powertrains during the 2019 unveiling of the wildly styled Cybertruck.\n\nIt was one of several electric pickups attracting huge consumer interest and poised to transform one of the auto industry\u2019s biggest segments.\n\n\u201cTrucks have been the same for a very long time, like 100 years,\u201d Musk said before a cheering audience. \u201cWe need something different.\u201d At one point during the presentation, a fan yelled back to Musk, \u201cTake my money.\u201d And Tesla did.\n\nRefundable reservations of $100 to $250 for the Cybertruck reached over 1 million by the time the unpainted pickup went into production in late 2023, Musk said. He predicted annual sales of 250,000 to half a million.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. Instead, the Cybertruck \u2014 like EV pickups from Ford, Rivian and General Motors \u2014 mostly failed to convert early preorders into meaningful sales in the truck-loving U.S.\n\nWhile automakers saw EV pickups as a potentially lucrative addition to their lineups, their capabilities were a mismatch with many buyers, analysts said. High prices and limited range for towing and hauling, compared with combustion rivals, didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cThe powertrain that people choose in their truck is a big deal,\u201d said Alex Knizek, associate director of test development at Consumer Reports. \u201cTo get that capability in an electric vehicle, you have to really stretch the boundaries of what an electric powertrain can do.\u201d\n\nElectric pickups aren\u2019t alone in failing to live up to the hype. EVs, in general, have missed aggressive industry targets and automakers are pulling back, Knizek said. \u201cWhen you look at pickup trucks, specifically, that is a big ship to try and steer. You have a lot of really loyal customers.\u201d\n\nThe Cybertruck logged about 40,000 U.S. registrations last year, making it the top electric pickup, according to S&P Global Mobility. Production was minimal in 2023 because of the launch late that year.\n\nThe F-150 Lightning also underperformed. Ford said just before its May 2022 launch that it had 200,000 reservations and expected to build 150,000 annually. But the Lightning had just 32,893 registrations last year and 24,695 in 2023.\n\nRivian last reported its reservation backlog in November 2022 at 114,000 for the R1T pickup and the R1S crossover combined. The R1T had 9,876 registrations last year and 11,311 in 2023, S&P Global Mobility said.\n\nTesla and Rivian don\u2019t break out sales by country or model, so registrations serve as a proxy.\n\nEV pickups had about 22,000 U.S. registrations in the first quarter this year, with the Lightning in the lead at 7,913, followed by the Cybertruck, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer, R1T and GMC Sierra EV, S&P Global Mobility said.\n\nComparable combustion pickups from Ford, Chevrolet, GMC and Ram reached 478,823 registrations in the first quarter. The No. 5 Toyota Tundra, with 36,895 registrations, outsold all EV pickups, the S&P Global Mobility data showed.\n\n**Buyers want to push limits with trucks**\n\nWhile there are plenty of happy EV truck owners using them for home gardening and family trips, the market is smaller than automakers had anticipated, analysts said. Even casual truck users generally want the option of pushing their limits.\n\nFord temporarily idled Lightning production last year because of lower-than-expected sales. Rivian cut delivery guidance for its R1 vehicles for 2025. And GM doubled down on combustion pickups with an $888 million investment in a Buffalo, N.Y., V-8 engine plant in May.\n\nTesla is pushing its EV pickup, offering a stripped-down Cybertruck without all-wheel drive in April with a starting price of $72,235 with shipping, $10,000 less than the previous base model.\n\n\u201cThe reason trucks were first built back in the 1920s with the Ford Model T chassis and the reason they\u2019re the bestselling vehicles now is because most people buy trucks to get work done,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. While not every pickup owner is a heavy user, it\u2019s still why they buy a truck, he said.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, electric drivetrains are the worst for getting things done. If you load up the bed, hook up the trailer, go to a bunch of worksites or on vacation, they have limited range and when it\u2019s time to refuel, it\u2019s a big pain in the ass,\u201d Brauer said.\n\nHigh prices and worries over public charging have also battered EV trucks, analysts said. Pickup buyers are less sensitive to fuel economy, Brauer said, because their primary focus is utility or adventure. And while EV pickups are more efficient, they also carry a higher up-front price.\n\n**Electric pickup prices higher than expected**\n\nChevrolet prices the base electric Silverado at $75,195 with shipping. The Cybertruck and R1T start over $70,000 with shipping. The Lightning starts at $65,190 with shipping. Higher trims can easily break $80,000 with destination charges.\n\nThose contrast with the prices advertised when the EV makers were taking reservations.\n\nAt the 2019 debut, Tesla promised a $40,000 version of the Cybertruck, but eliminated that model before launch. Ford briefly sold a commercial version of the Lightning for $41,669 with shipping in 2022 before raising prices. In January 2022, Chevrolet announced a base Silverado EV at $39,900 before shipping but never sold that model.\n\nThe sweet spot for full-size pickups, in general, is the $40,000 to $60,000 price range, said Luke Donahue, managing director of data and analytics at J.D. Power. And EV pickups would have to match the utility of combustion rivals to compete, he said.\n\nElectric pickups offer the power and torque needed to do truck things such as towing and hauling heavy loads, but they fall flat on range and fueling. While some EV pickups have 300 or even 400 miles of range, that\u2019s cut about in half when towing, analysts say, and refueling takes an hour or more.\n\nKnizek said he knows from testing the Lightning and R1T that \u201cYou have a lot of that low-end torque, so it was actually quite enjoyable to tow with some of these vehicles. It just doesn\u2019t last very long.\u201d\n\nOther automaker experiments with pickup electrification have been more successful. All hybrid trucks have sold well, automakers say, from the compact Ford Maverick at $29,840 with shipping to the full-size Tundra at $59,950 with shipping.\n\nA new startup, Slate Auto, plans to build a fully electric pickup in late 2026 with a focus on small size, low cost and customization, essentially doing the opposite of what EV pickup makers are doing, the company said.\n\nThe sub-$30,000 Slate truck comes unpainted with plastic body panels and a spartan interior with no infotainment and hand-crank windows. The company plans to sell accessories, including a conversion kit for the cargo bed that turns the pickup into a crossover.\n\nSlate Auto announced in May that 100,000 potential buyers had put down a $50 refundable deposit since the official product unveiling in late April.\n\nBut even Slate\u2019s low-cost approach is fraught with challenges to match the price and capability of combustion vehicles or hybrids, such as the sub-$30,000 Maverick, Brauer said.\n\nSlate said its truck will cost about $20,000 including the $7,500 EV tax incentive, which the Trump administration wants to scuttle. Without the credit, the base price is likely around $27,500 before shipping. Slate hasn\u2019t announced shipping prices.\n\n\u201cAll Slate did was show me how hard it is to make an inexpensive EV. They\u2019ve pulled every lever, no paint, no touchscreen, no power windows, only two seats. And it costs $27,500 before government incentives, which will be gone,\u201d Brauer said. \u201cWhy the hell would I buy the Slate over a Maverick?\u201d",

    "selftext": "I have a Tesla Model S 2019 I was charging in home garage using Tesla wall connector. I had the battery level set to be max 90%. When it was charging close to 90% , my home CO device went off. At beginning I didn\u2019t know it was related to my car, so I called 911 and PGE and got out of my house. Both of their devices had CO reading in my house, but they investigated everything in my house and couldn\u2019t find any gas leakage from any device. Eventually the PGE guy called his boss explaining the situation, and he asked if there was EV and suggested to open the frunk and trunk to check it (since that\u2019s the closest to the battery), the guy used the device and indeed found the reading of CO, especially the part in the trunk where it\u2019s closest to the charging port, the reading was over 100 PPM. (I already unplugged my charger when I got out of the house an hour ago, so it was not actively charging but they still got the reading) I have requested Tesla service appointment at this point and waiting for that to come. I saw there are some people online saying H2 can be misread as CO, but that was about charging lead acid battery which is different from Tesla battery. I wonder if anyone had similar experience or may have some ideas as to why the car would emit some gas that trigger the CO alarm.",

    "title": "Built a simple solution for tracking all my charging costs across different apps/providers",
    "selftext": "Hey fellow EV drivers!\n\nLike many, I got tired of juggling multiple charging apps just to figure out how much I'm actually spending on charging. Between having to use all the big charging providers as well as whatever random app the grocery store charger uses... I was losing track of my actual costs.\n\nAs a new EV owner in Europe, it's even more fragmented - every street charger, shopping center, and highway station seems to have its own provider and pricing structure. Sound familiar?\n\nSo during some late-night dad hours (thanks, kids! \ud83d\ude34), I decided to build something simple to consolidate all my charging session data in one place. Nothing fancy - just a clean way to log:\n\n* Date/time of charge\n* Which provider/location\n* Charger type (slow/fast/supercharger/home)\n* Price per kWh\n* Total session cost\n\nIt automatically groups everything by month so I can actually see my charging patterns and costs over time. Works great on mobile since that's usually what I have when I'm at a charging station.\n\nThe whole thing is privacy-focused (your data stays yours) and supports multiple currencies. Now I can more easily spot which providers are consistently cheaper in my area.\n\n**This is just a personal hobbyist project with no ads or monetization** \\- built it because I needed it, figured others might too, I will track hosting costs over time and try and keep the concept going as long as it makes sense to do so.\n\n[rechargelog.com](http://rechargelog.com) \\- still very much a work in progress but happy to hear feedback from fellow EV owners!\n\n[Capture New Charge Session Data](https://preview.redd.it/6qr3dsd90q4f1.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=88eaee777939ec6ceacefe6785a4008ffda084af)\n\n[View History \\/ Edit \\/ Delete](https://preview.redd.it/qiu2x35a0q4f1.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecb1271cab40df845228747a7c39abafacdc67d)\n\n\\*NEW\\* insights screen\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oemd86d8zn8f1.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=610b8f23b1d2ebb4b5723ec00fd504887c0a0098\n\n",

    "selftext": "The current EV market in the USA right now is broken.\n\nResale values for EVs is very low and people are getting rid of these hot potato vehicles before they hit their warranty expiration.\n\nOnce these vehicles hit the used car market people are scared of touching them for fear of a huge $10-$20k new high voltage battery bill.\n\nThe proponents of the current status quo say everything is Ok the risk of battery failure is overstated with links to mickey mouse studies saying how great the batteries are and how long they last.\n\nThe EV manufacturer warranties are pretty crappy, most are about 100,000 miles. I think Rivian has one that is 175,000 miles or so which is better.\n\nThe proponents say that 100,000 miles is the normal life of a gas engine so 100,000 is fine. I guess most of these people never owned gas cars for long because 200,000 miles is the new 100,000 mile limit people sort of set in their heads for expected life.  100,000 miles was probably a big deal in 60s or 70s but not anymore.\n\nSo if battery failures are so uncommon then why do I see videos with people having Teslas towed away for battery replacement or see posts with people posting invoices showing the battery cost? Companies can make the battery warranty 200,000 miles then if it is so uncommon.\n\nThe insurance companies will not cover the battery failures from my understanding and the one company that I found offering such coverage has only been doing so for a year or so and does not seem like a legitimate insurance company to me.\n\nThe aftermarket companies offering battery replacements I could not find any in my city. The closest thing I found is some places like Ebay selling used batteries and some other place selling refurbished batteries so not the most reassuring.\n\nSo basically until the car manufacturers solve this issue, people are gonna be trading in their 4 yr old EVs like they trade in iPhone for new model and the old cars will probably be sent to the third world for scrap metal or recycling.\n\nAnyways that is my opinion.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please",
    "selftext": "TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. \n\nFor context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).\nCentral Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.\n\nOur goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. \n\nI'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. \nLearning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.\n\nExample a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. \nDigging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:\nKia Sportage PHEV 40\nKia Sorento PHEV 45\nMazda CX-90 PHEV 58\n\nWe do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan. Obviously since we regularly use the allocation and dip into Tier 2 most months, any home EV charging above our current usage would be billed as Tier 2 rates (currently $0.51/kWh). That means the above vehicles would cost 20, 23, or 30 cents per mile for their EV-only powertrain. Which is way more than we currently pay for gasoline so on paper it doesn't appear to pan out. \n\nHowever, it appears to have any benefit, you need to structure your life around a specific time-of-use rate plan, geared for EVs. The simplest one is basically allowing 12am-3pm (overnight and all day) charging at a reduced rate of $0.31/kWh. 3-4pm and 9pm-12 is the same $0.51 as current T2, and 4pm-9pm is $0.62 as a \"penalty\" for using during peak hours. (Yes, for all of you paying $0.10 or less per kWh on average in other states, that is what we have to deal with here)\n\nThat brings me to the new math of $0.31/kwh x 40kwh/100 miles = 12.4 cents per mile (for Kia Sportage PHEV), 14 for Sorento, and 18 cents for CX-90.\nUntil gasoline prices shoot up here, the PHEV doesn't look any better on paper. \n\nAs a side note, even though we don't want to deal with range anxiety, we notice regular EVs tend to have a far better efficiency rating in this sense. A Tesla Y is 27kWh/100 miles, meaning (at this special PG&E rate plan) our total cost for home charging would be 8.4 cents per mile. \n\nIs there other math I need to consider in this? \nAre different chargers more or less efficient than others?\nWould Level 1 or Level 2 charging have a drastically different $/kwh effect on our energy bill?\nDo the mpge and kWh/100mi ratings on the vehicles mean little, do they get better or worse field results?\nAre you tired of reading yet?",

    "title": "First-Time EV Buyer's Guide",
    "selftext": "I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). \n\n#The Starting Line\nSo you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. \n\nLet me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full \"tank\" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. \n\n# Assess your situation\nAs always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: \n\n* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can \"refuel\" at home, every night. In contrast, the \"worst\" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas. It's less common, but you can also 100% get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit. \n* What's your normal daily mileage? How much battery do you need? Almost all full battery-powered EVs (BEVs) have >200 miles of range at this point. You could even look at plug-in hybrid EV (PHEVs) if you fit the specific use-case for it (short daily use, home charging, and regular longer road trips) although having a more complex vehicle that retains all the maintenance of a gas engine is, for many, too much of a drawback when BEVs are becoming so capable. \n* Do you plan to use this vehicle to regularly travel to a certain destination more than 100 miles away? Like a weekend ski trip or family in another state? You can use apps like plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP) to plot out these trips and see what public charging is available. Almost nowhere in the US is completely inaccessible to EVs anymore, but some places are much less convenient. \n* Another way to ask the previous question is: do you have another vehicle in your household? A gas vehicle is, in 99% of cases, indisputably better for long distance travel compared to an EV. If you decide that your vehicle will only ever charge at home (outside of emergencies), you can completely ignore fast charging rates, which are relatively difficult to research and understand. \n* There are [calculators](https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/) online to [determine](https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/) how much [you'll save](https://chargevc.org/ev-calculator/) on fuel by switching to electric. It obviously depends heavily on your particular situation, but rule of thumb is (assuming you charge at home) you'll spend 1/3 of what you spent on gas ($1500 in a year -> $500 in a year), and you'll have minimal maintenance costs. I will say that if money is very tight, you'll find the best value in optimizing your purchase for your needs. A used Bolt, Leaf, or eGolf from the late 2010s won't have the range or charging speed of a Model 3 or Ioniq, but could save you a bunch of money if you just need to go from your garage to work every day. (/u/nzahn1 provided [additional recommendations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/muwjzjg/))\n\n# Do your research\nOnce you have a handle on your needs (miles of range, fast charging needs, etc.) you can start to actually look into cars. If you are new to EVs, you should contact a dealer and test drive one, ASAP. Doesn't even matter what kind, just go and try it. You'll never forget the first time you put the pedal to the floor in a Hyundai and it accelerates like a Porsche.  \n\nObviously, you'll have your own price range and vehicle preferences, but here's what you should know about the electric side of things. I would recommend starting with a filter for range and price, and survey which vehicles are in your budget that meet your needs. Give yourself a shortlist and then start to think about your particular use case, considering the following: \n\n\n* Maximum fast charging speed (sometimes called DCFC speed): Ignore this if you only plan on charging at home, because it determines your maximum speed at a fast charger. Usually given in kilowatts (kW) or alternatively described by \"10% to 80% charge time\", this is the *peak* charging rate. A number of 50 kW is almost unbearably low (60+ minutes to recharge), while 150 is solid and 200+ is as fast as they come (<20 minutes to recharge). This stat is not standardized so it has to be individually researched for each model you're interested in, and it's worth keeping in mind that it's a *maximum* value, which is affected by things like temperature and how many other people are charging. One thing that might be helpful is to go on PlugShare and check out the specific charging stations you expect to use. The app encourages \"check-ins\" from real users where they report their vehicle information as well as how their charge went. \n\n* \"Fuel\" efficiency: For ICE vehicles, miles per gallon (MPG) is a useful metric for showing the cost of running the vehicle. It's somewhat less important for EVs because electricity is generally cheaper than gas, but can be valuable information to know. Unfortunately, there are 3 metrics for this in EVs right now that all represent the same thing. Here's the short version: MPGe is an attempt to bridge the gap between gas and electric, so the raw number is mostly meaningless for anything besides comparison. Bigger number is better, typically above 100 MPGe. Miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh) is my favorite, since it's just miles/gallon but swapped to the common unit for electric energy. Bigger is better, and numbers range from ~2 for trucks and go up to ~5 for efficient sedans. You can invert it and get kWh/mi, and since this is a decimal it's often shown as kWh/100 miles. For this, *smaller* is better, and numbers range from 20 to 50. Vehicle-specific subreddits are usually a good source of people reporting their numbers, although be aware that people tend to self-report their good numbers more than their bad ones. \n\n* Understand what the \"range\" number means practically: EVs are more efficient in the city than on the highway, by a significant margin. This is because EVs are more affected by aerodynamics, and going faster will steadily eat into your range. Most \"highway range\" numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 65-70 mph, so if you want to go 80, you'll shrink your range (conversely, EV drivers will commonly \"extend\" their range if needed by simply going slower). Electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold, by like 20-30%. Combined, this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of ~200 miles of range in cold weather, and that's if you're charging to 100% and driving it down to 0%. Rain, wind, and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons. Good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter road trips and want to know the most reliable, practical range. Elevation and weather are also usually important. I recommend finding YouTube \"range tests\" of the type of car you want. There are tons of these online. \n\n* Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability: This is worth a mention basically because of Tesla, although other automakers are starting to offer some functionality, and the EV customer base makes for a good \"early adopter\" test market. It can be a very attractive feature, especially if you do a lot of driving. For reviews, I would watch some videos on your specific model or go to the vehicle-specific subreddit and ask around. This one is also really important to evaluate in a test drive. \n\n* Plug type: This is last because it's less important, since adapters exist, but you should know if the vehicle you want uses the NACS (also known as SAE J3400) or CCS plug type (SAE J1772). In the US in 2023, Tesla convinced everyone to adopt theirs as standard, which definitely won't be annoying for anyone. Starting in 2025, many new vehicles will be releasing with this plug type, and from 2026 on, most manufacturers that I'm aware of have committed to it exclusively (within the US). If you see a \"CHAdeMO\" plug type, run away; CHAdeMO isn't real, it can't hurt you. ^^Just ^^kidding ^^the ^^Leaf ^^is ^^fine, ^^just ^^kind ^^of ^^outdated ^^at ^^this ^^point. \n\n# How to charge\n\nDuring your vehicle research process, you should also, in parallel, determine how you're going to charge at home. You may already be aware of the different \"levels\": Level 1 charging is a basic wall outlet, Level 2 usually has a dedicated breaker and is basically a high voltage/amperage outlet, like you would get for industrial equipment. Level 3 is DC charging, and these are exclusively for public charging. To give some loose numbers, in order to add 50 miles of range, Level 1 takes 10-15 hours, Level 2 takes 2-5 hours, and level 3 takes less than an hour. \n\n**Many people can get by with basic level 1 charging, and do not need to spend ~$1000 on installing level 2 charging in their home**. Evaluate your daily driving, and how long your vehicle is parked at home. You still might want level 2 charging if you do anything that adds big spikes of driving into your schedule. It sucks to get back from a road trip and stress that you won't be charged enough to get to work the next day, or to leave for a road trip and *not* be at 100% because you charged too slow. \n\nIf your garage doesn't have electric hookups or your breaker box is in a weird spot in your basement or something, it will become quite expensive to install level 2 charging. Usually, it costs something like $400 for the hardware itself and $200-800 for basic installation. If you want specifics on which chargers are good, consult /r/evcharging. If nothing else, know that you need to ensure your equipment meets certain safety specs, so look for UL or ETL standards under product specs. \n\nEdit: Also, as /u/IM_Oscar_dot_com said, many states and/or utility companies offer incentives to help you set up charging stations in your home. See if you qualify before installation! \n\n# Making the purchase\nOnce you've drilled down on the vehicle you want, there's a few additional considerations that happen when you've fully locked in on the car you want and are ready to buy. \n\n* Tax credits: Although not relevant after Dec. 31 2025, [there are currently federal credits for EVs](https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits), both new and used. Read the link if interested, but the three big things you should know are: 1) there are requirements on your income and the vehicle price, 2) There's some other requirements based on the vehicle model year (if used) or country it was manufactured in (if new), and 3) for new vehicles there's a \"lease loophole\" that's fairly easy to take advantage of. Everyone's case is different, so just ask if you have more questions here. Lastly, be careful when shopping, since some dealers will incorporate the tax cut into the advertised price (assuming you qualify for the income requirements), while some do not. \n\n* General trends with EV sales (May, 2025): The big thing right now is that depreciation on EVs is relatively high compared to the rest of the car market (and doubly so for Teslas). Importantly, this is not for technical reasons. EV [battery degradation is minimal](https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/), electric motors are theoretically more reliable than gas with fewer moving parts, and 94% of people who have an EV plan to stay with EVs. However, EVs still occupy a bit of an \"early adopter\" niche, so the people who want them are more likely to buy new. Long story short - lease or buy a gently used vehicle for the best bang for your buck. But, like, I'm not your dad or anything, do what you want. \n\n* Test drive: Do not buy your first EV without a significant test drive. If you've done your research well, you'll likely know more about the vehicle than the sales rep. Try out different levels of regenerative braking. Sit with the tech interface for a bit, and see if anything pops out as annoying. Try the self-driving. If there are different drive modes, give them a test. Most people dislike one-pedal driving at first but fall in love with it later, so just leave that off if you can. Also, after driving it for 10-15 minutes, look at what the range is projecting and the current battery percentage. Use those numbers to get the range at 100%, and see how that stacks up with your expectations. This isn't 100% reliable, but it can be used for a quick check. \n\n#Common courtesies\n\n/u/polymath-nc made a good point about EV common courtesy things. Like at a busy gas station, it's polite to move your car as soon as its done pumping. For EVs, there's a few other things that might not be obvious to you: \n\n* Don't charge to 100% at a DCFC charger, especially if there are others waiting. They slow down dramatically as the car approaches 100%, so you're just you're just wasting everyone's time (including yourself!). It's always going to be faster to drive down to <10% and then charge until the charging slows down (usually ~80%). \n\n* If you have a relatively slow charging vehicle (Bolt is a common example with a max speed of 50 kW), you should be considerate when using fast chargers. If you have a choice between a 100 kW charger and a 350 kW charger, it won't make any difference to you which you use, while an Ioniq will take twice as long to charge at the 100 kW charger. \n\n* CHAdeMO plugs are relatively rare and often included as a second cable on a CCS charger. If you've got a CCS/NACS vehicle, treat it like the handicapped stall in the bathroom (they are using CHAdeMO after all), where you should use it only if the other chargers are full. \n\n* Many Supercharger stations have short cords because they were optimized for Teslas, meaning that non-Teslas might have to take up two spaces to connect to their vehicle. If they can (again, handicapped stall logic), Tesla users should leave the end spots open to minimize this, and non-Tesla users should use those end spots rather than take up two spaces.\n\n# Thanks for reading!\n\nHopefully this helps someone! Please feel free to leave a comment or suggest anything. If there's advice from non-US sources, I'd be happy to include it. If you're someone reading this in the future, please feel free to ask your question directly. If it's a specific \"should I buy this car\" request, be sure to give detailed information about your location, driving needs, budget, etc. \n\nEdited in the first few comments. Thanks, and keep them coming!",

    "title": "New 3-row EV comparison",
    "selftext": "Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM\n\n* **Kia EV9**\n   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).\n   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as \"not all that much,\" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an \"easy justification\" for the price.\n   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.\n* **Cadillac Vistic**\n   * **Price:** Described as \"quite a bit more money than the Kia,\" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.\n   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car. The range is mentioned as being one of the \"big oversightes\".\n   * **Charging Performance:** The charging performance \"sucks,\" taking about 40 something minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. The peak charging speed is only 185-190 kW, making it the only vehicle in the comparison that can't hit 200 kW. The charging curve involves a boost profile for 5 to 10 minutes at 500 amps, then drops down, and is generally \"not a great curve\". It has \"crap charging performance,\" described as the \"worst of the bunch\". It requires a very low voltage system and needs \"all the amps in the world\".\n* **Volvo EX90**\n   * **Price:** Very expensive, with the as-tested price being $94,000. A base lease was mentioned as almost $1,100 per month. It is described as priced \"pretty well\" because it feels expensive. It feels more expensive than the Rivian by a lot.\n   * **Range:** On paper, the range is described as \"kind of mid-tier\". It has around 100 kWh usable battery capacity.\n   * **Charging Performance:** On paper, the charging is also described as \"kind of mid-tier\". It's a low voltage system architecture that requests 600 amps or more from a charging station, but public infrastructure in the US doesn't widely support this. On a Supercharger, it's locked at 500 amps, resulting in about 210 kW charging. Volvo claims 10-80% charging in 30 minutes, which is described as \"not that bad,\" but the curve is stepped. Its charging performance \"feels a bit weak sauce\" and \"a little bit prototypy,\" though potentially improvable over the air. It is one of the better vehicles in the comparison for charging time (10-80% in about 30 minutes). It is the only non-Tesla passenger vehicle sold in the US that requests more than 500 amps.\n* **Rivian R1S**\n   * **Price:** The most expensive vehicle in the comparison, with the as-tested price being $105,000. However, a Rivian R1S can be had for as low as $75,000. At $105,000, it's speced up with pretty much everything. The price is mentioned as something they \"don't like\". Even at $75,000 for a base one, it's considered \"kind of okay,\" but the quality is felt to have gone down from the first generation, and features are more often options now.\n   * **Range:** Has the biggest battery of the bunch, around 145 kilowatt hours. It has the most range of capability.\n   * **Charging Performance:** The peak charging speed is 210 kW on the tested model, which was slightly lower than an older Rivian model that got 219 kW. The charging performance \"sucks\" mostly due to thermal management. It's a big battery with weak cooling, causing the battery to get hot and limiting subsequent charging sessions. It's expensive to rely on DC charging with the Rivian as it's described as a \"brick\" and is the least efficient. It interfaces with the Supercharger network through an adapter and will soon have native ports.\n\nIn summary, the **Kia EV9** stands out for its **value** and solid, consistent charging performance up to 80%, despite having the lowest price and less overall range. The **Cadillac Vistic** is noted as a good highway cruiser but is criticized for its **slow charging speeds** and relatively small battery capacity for its price. The **Volvo EX90** is expensive but praised for feeling premium and driving well, with a good charging time, though its charging architecture is complex and its range/charging specs aren't top-tier on paper. The **Rivian R1S** is the most expensive vehicle, capable off-road, and has the biggest battery and most range, but is criticized for its build quality issues, relatively slow charging speeds for its battery size, and poor thermal management during consecutive charging sessions. The EV9 is considered the best budget option, the Vistic for the \"American guy\" who wants a cruiser, the EX90 is the preferred choice for on-road driving and overall quality, and the Rivian is for the \"lifestyle person\" who needs off-road capability.",

I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as \"fuel\".*\u00a0\n\n*\\*\\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to \"close that loophole\", which for me, looks to be \"fair\" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.*\u00a0\n\nI have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on \"fuel\". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.\n\n**Currently ex-depreciation/any cost of the vehicle, the Tesla is already winning at 15c/mile vs. the Corolla's 16c/mile** due to the cheaper maintenance and fuel despite the higher insurance and tabs. **But taking into account depreciation changes that comparison to $0.34 vs. $0.20 in favor of the Corolla - for now.** Which is a price I'm comfortable paying for enhanced safety, comfort, etc. \n\n**EFFICIENCY**  \nBecause it's always interesting to discuss - this is my \"efficiency\" based on the electricity I am actually paying for so it includes losses (and I am adding in charging away from home but that's been extremely minimal). The Tesla itself reports a different number: **239 Mi/kWh (vs 296)** which is partially due to losses and partially due to the car not reporting preconditioning.\u00a0 Similarly the **Tesla app says 8,771 kWh charged vs. I have logged 9,028** (a 3% variance) which tells me the 20% variance on Mi/kWh is primarily preconditioning and not charging losses - which is surprising given I do not precondition very frequently and I do not use Sentry. I charge L2.\u00a0",

    "title": "Electric trains, buses and cycles are more efficient and practical ways of electrification than electric cars!",
    "selftext": "Electric trains and buses have existed for century. Massive transit systems like Newyork Subway, London underground, Paris metro, Moscow metro, trams and trolleys have been successfully fully running electricity for nearly a century. \n\nIndia has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.\n\nThen we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.\n\nhttps://www.bicycling.com/news/a39838840/ebikes-are-outpacing-electric-car-sales-in-the-us/\n\nTrolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.\n\nElectrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.\n\nhttps://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bloomberg-new-energy-finance-long-term-forecast-on-electric-buses-vehicles/\n\n\n You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.\n\nThen we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.\n\nYou can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.\n\nThen the amount of infrastructure needed. One metro line with 2 track (1+1) can transportore people than a 100 lane road (50+50). One dedicated bus lane can transport more people than 6-8 lanes of cars. One cycle lane can transport as much people as a 6 lanes of cars.\n\nImagine how much land we can conserve with electric trains and buses as opposed to cars.\n\nThen we come to affordability. As said earlier 99% of indian railways and 75% of Chinese railways are already electrified. So I don't think 99% of Indians can afford Teslas or any other electric car brands. But they can definitely afford those trains. China for example has 40,000 km of electrified highspeed railways. And 11,000 km of electricetro railways. \n\nThen comes life quality. From Beijing to Shanghai it takes only 4 hours and 15 minutes by highspeed trains. It takes a lot more time on an electric car.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zYJPOZbhXTA?si=9mriiHBIwzWDWZzG\n\nAnd let's see how much permanent magnets does electric trains vs cars consume. An electric car has 200 kW to 300 kW motor. And they can transport at maximum 4 people comfortably. So 50 to 75 kW of motor per passneger. \n\nEven highspeed trains like N700 shinkansen can transport 1323 people with only 17,080 kW motor power. So it comes down to only 12 kW per passeger. Remember this train can travel at a speed of 200 mph (320 kmph). \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N700_Series_Shinkansen\n\n\nThis even lower for normal speed trains which travel at maximum of 160 kmph (100 mph). Take for example Vandebharat EMU. It can transport 1,128 passnegers with only 6,720 kW motor power. So 5.95 kW per passenger. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vande_Bharat_(trainset)\n\nSo nearly 10 times lower motor capacity needed per passenger compared to electric cars.\n\nI still think electric cars are better than combustion cars. But they are not the whole solution. Not even a big part of solution towards decarbonization of transportation.",

I wanted to share some of my experiences so far after 20,000km. If you have any questions - feel free to ask.\n\nFor context, I previously drove mainly BMW and Audi, and I also have about two years of experience with a Tesla Model 3 LR, plus a few months each with a Polestar 2 and VW ID.4 \u2013 so those are the benchmarks I\u2019m comparing this car to.\n\n# Overall impression\n\nA high-quality vehicle with an amazing interior and strong pricing, though it has some limitations when it comes to charging in winter.\n\n# \ud83d\udcb0 Price & Value\n\nI don\u2019t think many EVs can beat the price/performance ratio of this Peugeot.  \nMine is fully loaded: infotainment, panoramic roof, heated *and* cooled seats front & rear \u2013 all for just over \u20ac60K in Germany. The hardware quality is on par with VW and Polestar, slightly below Audi, but far above my 2021 Tesla Model 3.\n\n# \ud83d\udecb\ufe0f Interior\n\nI really love it. Everything is super fast \u2013 no lag when opening maps or menus. The interface is intuitive, and shortcuts for common functions are easy to access. Took me maybe 5 minutes to get used to, and now I\u2019m a fan. The adaptive cruise control is amazing and the best I have ever had in a car. The side assist is not ideal as the car drives slightly drunk from left to right.\n\n# \ud83d\udd0a Sound system\n\nI love bass-heavy music \u2013 and this sound system is **insanely** loud. Honestly, you can\u2019t even turn it all the way up unless you want your ears to bleed.

    "title": "EV\u2019s have been taking off in my city and I finally figured out why",
    "selftext": "I live in a pretty rural area of western Pennsylvania and after paying a bit of attention to the specific cars around me, I got a good idea of how many EV\u2019s were in my city. Outside of my own I had only ever really seen a couple Tesla\u2019s but they weren\u2019t popular. Less than 10, probably closer to 5 throughout the city. \n\nOver the past year there were a couple more that popped up including an EV9, and a Nissan Ariya. I\u2019ve seen a couple chevy\u2019s, both Blazers and equinox, and even a mustang. But the last couple months they\u2019ve exploded. In My neighborhood there are 4 prologues out of nowhere. They\u2019re easy to identify since I work from home and my desk is by the window near the stop sign. I always hear them as they come to a stop (the prologues are actually pretty loud with their hums) and they\u2019re three different colors and the fourth has a bunch of decals. I\u2019ve also seen some new blazers around. \n\nI stopped in at a local shop and was talking to the owner like normal and she mentioned getting a Blazer. Last person I would\u2019ve thought, and 70+ year old lady on the verge of retirement. I asked what made her switch and she explained. She took her ICE in to get it serviced and the dealer made a new policy. Any loaner vehicle that wasn\u2019t kept overnight required to be an EV. She said it was the safest and most comfortable she\u2019s ever been in a car. She said she got her car back and that\u2019s really when she felt how much she missed the car. She went back 2 weeks later to buy what she test drove. And the family that owns the dealership she goes to also owns the Honda dealership. \n\nThat\u2019s the biggest obstacle. Getting people to drive one, not necessarily buy them. Obviously the end goal is to buy and get more on the road, but instead of just talk talk talk, focus on just getting people to drive one. She wasn\u2019t encouraged to buy it, just given it for a day. And that\u2019s likely what happened with a lot of the prologues. GM and Honda are massive brands and have a lot of brand loyalty. There are people who won\u2019t go to another brand with better vehicles just because they\u2019re that loyal to these brands. This really is something dealers need to do more often. If they have loaner vehicles they need to prioritize using EV\u2019s for them. It will sell cars. ",

    "title": "My EV journey to a Tesla Model Y",
    "selftext": "My first EV was a Nissan Leaf a decade ago.\nHowever, that only lasted for one year because of the lack of charging\ninfrastructure in the UK and the range on the car. I moved back to a diesel BMW for a few years. Following that I leased a Ford Kuga Plug in Hybrid and loved being able to drive on electric again.\nI set out in February with the intention of buying another electric car with at least 200 miles of range. I have regular needs for this with my work. So, my first choice was a Polestar 2. However, on closer consideration and after riding in a few, I was concerned about the charging infrastructure again and how annoying it is to have 10 different charging cards and apps.\nSo, I decided to get a Tesla Model 3 Long Range. There is a self service Tesla test drive station near me, so I went to be sure the Model 3 was the right car for me and also drove the Model Y as it was available at the same time. And, my mind was changed again. I have a family of two children and the space in the Model Y was just so much more comparable to the Ford Kuga. I was concerned that we would out grow the Model 3 fairly quickly. So, I started my search for a Tesla Model Y Long Range Dual Motor.\nWhat we love about the Tesla Model Y so far is:\n\n- The vehicle entertainment and navigation on the one big screen works amazingly well.\nReally well done and easy to use. I was worried about this as a recent lease of a Cupra Formentor had a really annoyed nested menu for things like the heated seats and I just wanted a button. But Tesla have done really well in my opinion.\n- The car drives so well, the throttle response is great, you can drive smooth as a limousine but then when you need it the instant high torque is available immediately.\n- The cargo space and interior space is fantastic for family road trips. We haven't struggled to fit everything in for family weekends away, even with two children's bikes in the back.\n- Charging with the Supercharger network is\nAMAZING. It is effortless and just works as it should. No more planning the trip the night before on a charger networks route planner.\nThe car just plans it for us with Supercharger stops on route where needed. No app or anything needed, just plug in and charge straight away.\n- Camping in the car is also yet to be experienced in a couple of weeks. Let me know if you would like an update on that.",

    "title": "New US and Canadian CCS chargers in April 2025",
    "selftext": "Hey electrons,\n\n**Here are all (\\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in April 2025,**\u00a0according to the US Department of Energy. You can\u00a0[get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).\n\nThese chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:\n\n1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.\n2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in\u00a0r/leaf.\n\n**Some of these chargepoints will be \"refreshes,\"**\u00a0e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.\n\n**There were 300 CCS charging stations with a total of 986 chargepoints added or refreshed in April 2025.**\u00a0For comparison, there were 264 new CCS charging stations in April 2024, with 797 chargepoints.\n\nThis month saw an increase relative to April of last year, and also an increase relative to last month, especially with regard to chargepoints. Looking at the data, I cast side-eye on a few of the largest numbers, but overall it looks plausible.\n\nNote that several of these are Tesla Superchargers with Magic Dock. This has a significant influence especially on the number of total chargepoints.\n\n**NOTE:**\u00a0most Tesla Superchargers still do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (but any that are shown in this report should have it). I recommend using the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.\u00a0**Be aware some stations with Magic Dock still have short cords,**\u00a0which require most CCS vehicles to block two chargers. Newly listed ones here probably have long cords, but you might want to test them out when it's not Christmas Eve.\n\n**(\\*) \"What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?\"**\n\nTesla has said they will allow cars from participating automakers to charge at v3 and newer Superchargers without Magic Dock. Since then there has clearly been a delay in the rollout. Today Ford, Rivian, Hyundai, GM, Rivian, Nissan, Polestar and BMW owners can order adapters from the manufacturer of their vehicle. [Others are coming soon.](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/tesla-superchargers-open-to-other-evs-what-to-know-a9262067544/#:~:text=BMW%2C%20Mini%2C%20and%20Rolls%2D,Tesla%20Superchargers%20that%20same%20year)\n\nHowever, since non-magic-dock superchargers are open to only\u00a0*some*\u00a0CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, both those that support\u00a0*all*\u00a0CCS vehicles and those that only support the manufacturers currently permitted to use an adapter.\n\n**\"What about non-Tesla EVs with a built-in NACS port? Can they use all superchargers?\"**\n\nSo far there is only one sold in volume: the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. Even with a built-in NACS port, it can only use newer superchargers (generation 3 or better). However, [even with this car you may have to block two stalls at Gen 3 stations with short cords, ](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/23/hyundais-new-tesla-charging-port-comes-up-short/)so for now it's not significantly better than using a NACS adapter and you will need a CCS adapter for other stations.\n\n**\"Will the AFDC data continue to be available?\"**\n\nSo far, DOGE cuts don't seem to have affected the source data for this report.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nTo streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.\n\nFor serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.\n\nIf you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open.
